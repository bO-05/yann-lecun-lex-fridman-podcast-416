# Learning Hierarchical Representations

Learning hierarchical representations of action plans is a crucial challenge in AI research. To understand the importance of this task, let's consider the example of planning a trip from New York to Paris, as mentioned by Yann LeCun in the podcast.

<Steps>
### Step 1: High-level planning

At the highest level, you might break down the task into two sub-goals:
1. Go to the airport
2. Catch a plane to Paris

### Step 2: Mid-level planning

Each sub-goal can be further divided into smaller tasks:
- Going to the airport:
  - Go down to the street
  - Hail a taxi
- Catching a plane to Paris:
  - Check-in at the airport
  - Go through security
  - Board the plane

### Step 3: Low-level planning

At the lowest level, each task can be broken down into a sequence of actions:
- Going down to the street:
  - Stand up from the chair
  - Open the office door
  - Walk to the elevator
  - Press the elevator button
- Hailing a taxi:
  - Exit the building
  - Signal a taxi
  - Open the taxi door
  - Enter the taxi
</Steps>

As humans, we effortlessly plan and execute tasks at various levels of abstraction. However, for AI systems, learning to do this remains a significant challenge. Current AI systems can perform hierarchical planning when the levels of representation are designed by hand, but learning these hierarchical representations autonomously is an open problem.

Hierarchical planning is essential for AI systems to efficiently solve complex tasks by breaking them down into manageable sub-goals and actions at different levels of abstraction.

To illustrate the concept of hierarchical representations, consider the following diagram:

graph TD
A[Goal: Travel from New York to Paris] --> B[Sub-goal 1: Go to the airport]
A --> C[Sub-goal 2: Catch a plane to Paris]
B --> D[Task 1: Go down to the street]
B --> E[Task 2: Hail a taxi]
C --> F[Task 3: Check-in at the airport]
C --> G[Task 4: Go through security]
C --> H[Task 5: Board the plane]
D --> I[Action 1: Stand up from the chair]
D --> J[Action 2: Open the office door]
D --> K[Action 3: Walk to the elevator]
D --> L[Action 4: Press the elevator button]
E --> M[Action 5: Exit the building]
E --> N[Action 6: Signal a taxi]
E --> O[Action 7: Open the taxi door]
E --> P[Action 8: Enter the taxi]
```

Researchers are exploring various approaches to learning hierarchical representations, such as:

- Hierarchical reinforcement learning
- Goal-conditioned policies
- Option frameworks

However, there is still a long way to go before AI systems can learn hierarchical representations as efficiently and flexibly as humans do.

In conclusion, learning hierarchical representations of action plans is a critical step towards developing AI systems that can reason, plan, and solve complex tasks in a more human-like manner. Addressing this challenge will require innovative approaches and continued research efforts in the field of AI.
