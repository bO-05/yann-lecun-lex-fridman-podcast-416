# The Future of AI and Humanity

Yann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Meta, believes that AI will play a crucial role in amplifying human intelligence and making humanity smarter. He draws parallels between the potential impact of AI and the invention of the printing press, which revolutionized the spread of knowledge and enabled the Enlightenment, rationalism, democracy, and scientific progress.

## AI as an Amplifier of Human Intelligence

LeCun envisions a future where every individual has access to a staff of smart AI assistants, potentially even smarter than their human counterparts. These AI assistants will help execute tasks more efficiently and effectively than humans could on their own. Rather than feeling threatened by this prospect, LeCun encourages embracing the idea of having machines that are smarter than us assisting in our daily lives, both professionally and personally.

> "AI basically will amplify human intelligence. It's as if every one of us will have a staff of smart AI assistants they might be smarter than us, they'll do our bidding, perhaps execute a task in ways that are much better than we could do ourselves because they'll be smarter than us." - Yann LeCun

## The Printing Press Analogy

LeCun compares the potential impact of AI to the invention of the printing press, which made books more accessible and affordable, incentivizing people to learn to read. This access to knowledge enabled:

- The Enlightenment
- Philosophy
- Rationalism
- Democracy
- Science

Without the printing press, LeCun argues, we might still be living under feudal regimes. However, he also acknowledges that the printing press contributed to 200 years of religious conflicts in Europe, as people gained access to the Bible and developed interpretations that differed from the teachings of the Catholic Church. Despite these conflicts, LeCun asserts that the overall effect of the printing press was positive.

The Ottoman Empire banned the printing press for Arabic texts for 200 years, in part to preserve the corporation of calligraphers and maintain control over religious dogma. LeCun asks, "Who are we protecting by banning AI?"

## [AI and Job Market](/future-of-ai-humanity/ai-and-job-market)

LeCun discusses the potential impact of AI on the job market and the labor market, acknowledging that while AI may cause gradual shifts in professions, it is unlikely to lead to mass unemployment. He emphasizes the difficulty in predicting the most in-demand professions 10-15 years from now, just as it would have been challenging to foresee the rise of mobile app developers 20 years ago.

## [Empowering Human Goodness](/future-of-ai-humanity/empowering-human-goodness)

LeCun believes that people are fundamentally good, and if AI, especially open-source AI, can make them smarter, it will empower the goodness in humans. He argues that many "AI doomers" hold their views because they don't trust people or institutions to do the right thing. In contrast, LeCun and many others in the AI community believe in humanity and the potential for AI to support human progress.

As AI continues to advance, it is crucial to consider its potential impact on society and to work towards harnessing its power to amplify human intelligence and empower the fundamentally good nature of humans. By embracing open-source AI and fostering a diverse ecosystem of AI assistants, we can work towards a future in which AI serves as a tool for human progress and enlightenment.
