# Introduction

In this insightful podcast, [Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/) engages in a thought-provoking conversation with **Yann LeCun**, the Chief AI Scientist at Meta, professor at NYU, and Turing Award winner. LeCun, widely regarded as one of the most influential researchers in the history of artificial intelligence (AI), shares his perspectives on the future of AI, the importance of open source, and the limitations of large language models (LLMs).

Throughout the discussion, LeCun delves into various aspects of AI research and development, including:

- The [limitations of autoregressive LLMs](/limitations-of-llms) in achieving superhuman intelligence
- The potential of [joint embedding architectures](/joint-embedding-architectures) as a better approach to AI
- The significance of [reasoning, planning, and hierarchical representations](/reasoning-planning-hierarchical-representations) in AI systems
- The benefits of [open source AI platforms](/open-source-ai-regulation) in ensuring diversity and preventing concentration of power
- The impact of AI on the future of [humanity and the job market](/future-of-ai-humanity)
