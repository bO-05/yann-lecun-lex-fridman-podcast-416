# Importance of Sensory Input

Yann LeCun emphasizes the crucial role of sensory input in the development of intelligent systems. He argues that most of our knowledge is derived from observation and interaction with the real world, rather than language alone.

  A four-year-old child has been awake for approximately 16,000 hours, during which the amount of information reaching their visual cortex is about $10^{15}$ bytes. In contrast, the entirety of publicly available text data used to train large language models (LLMs) is around $2 \times 10^{13}$ bytes, equivalent to 170,000 years of reading at 8 hours per day.

This vast difference in the amount of information processed highlights the importance of sensory input in learning and understanding the world. While language is a compressed form of information, it lacks the richness and redundancy present in sensory data, which is essential for self-supervised learning algorithms to capture the internal structure of the inputs.

## The Role of Embodiment in Intelligence

Many researchers, particularly those working on computer vision, believe that AI systems need to be embodied to develop a true understanding of the world. This idea is supported by the fact that animals, which lack language, can still develop a sophisticated understanding of their environment through sensory experiences and interactions.

### Step 1

Babies learn about the world primarily through observation in the first few months of life, without the ability to interact with their environment.

### Step 2

As infants grow, they begin to interact with the world around them, learning about object permanence, causality, and other fundamental concepts through experimentation and play.

### Step 3

By the time a child reaches the age of four, they have accumulated a vast amount of knowledge about the world, largely through sensory experiences, which forms the foundation for further learning and language acquisition.

## Limitations of Language-Based Learning

While LLMs have demonstrated impressive performance on various language tasks, LeCun argues that they lack the grounding in reality necessary for developing true intelligence. He points out that many tasks humans take for granted, such as learning to drive a car or loading a dishwasher, cannot be easily learned by LLMs, as they require an understanding of the physical world that goes beyond language.

To address these limitations, LeCun proposes focusing on [joint embedding architectures](/joint-embedding-architectures) that learn abstract representations of sensory data, rather than relying solely on language-based learning. By incorporating sensory input and embodiment into AI systems, he believes we can make significant progress towards achieving human-level intelligence.
