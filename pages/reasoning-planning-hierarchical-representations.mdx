# Reasoning, Planning, and Hierarchical Representations

In this section, we dive into Yann LeCun's thoughts on the importance of reasoning, planning, and hierarchical representations in AI systems. LeCun emphasizes that these capabilities are crucial for achieving more advanced and intelligent AI systems.

## Why Reasoning and Planning Matter

Reasoning and planning are fundamental aspects of human intelligence. We use these skills to solve complex problems, make decisions, and navigate the world around us. For AI systems to exhibit similar levels of intelligence, they must be able to reason about their environment and plan their actions accordingly.

LeCun argues that current AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), lack the ability to reason and plan effectively. While LLMs can generate impressive outputs, they often struggle with tasks that require deeper understanding and logical reasoning.

## The Role of Hierarchical Representations

Hierarchical representations play a crucial role in enabling reasoning and planning in AI systems. Just as humans break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks, AI systems need to learn hierarchical representations of their environment and actions.

LeCun provides an example of planning a trip from New York to Paris:

<Steps>
### Step 1

At a high level, the objective is to minimize the distance to Paris. This can be broken down into two sub-goals:
1. Go to the airport
2. Catch a plane to Paris

### Step 2

The sub-goal of going to the airport can be further decomposed:
1. Go down to the street
2. Hail a taxi

### Step 3

Going down to the street involves even more granular actions:
1. Stand up from the chair
2. Open the office door
3. Go to the elevator
4. Push the elevator button
</Steps>

This example demonstrates how a complex task can be hierarchically decomposed into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. LeCun emphasizes that AI systems need to learn these hierarchical representations to effectively reason and plan.

By understanding the importance of reasoning, planning, and hierarchical representations, we can work towards building AI systems that exhibit more advanced and intelligent behavior, bringing us closer to the goal of human-level AI.
