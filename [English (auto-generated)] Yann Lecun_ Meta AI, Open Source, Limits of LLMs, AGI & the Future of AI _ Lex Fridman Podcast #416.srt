1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,080
I see the danger of this concentration

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,680
of power to to proprietary AI systems as

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,240
a much bigger danger than everything

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,960
else what works against this is people

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,120
who think that for reasons of security

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,680
we should keep AI systems under lock and

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,840
key because it's too dangerous to put it

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,560
in the hands of of everybody that would

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,560
lead to a very bad future in which all

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,359
of our information diet is controlled by

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,679
a small number of uh uh companies

12
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,759
through proprietary systems I believe

13
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,480
that people are fundamentally good and

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,239
so if

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,360
AI especially open source AI can um make

16
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,840
them smarter it just empowers the

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,520
goodness in humans so I I share that

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,079
feeling okay I think people are Fally

19
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,960
good uh and in fact a lot of doomers are

20
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,079
doomers because they don't think that

21
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,640
people are fundamentally

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,280
good the following is a conversation

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,039
with Yan laon his third time on this

24
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,720
podcast he is the chief AI scientist at

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,960
meta professor at NYU touring Award

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,840
winner and one of the seminal figures in

27
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,280
the history of artificial intelligence

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,799
he and meta AI have been big proponents

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,799
of open sourcing AI development and have

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,280
been walking the walk by open sourcing

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,360
many of their biggest models including

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,520
llama 2 and eventually llama 3 also Yan

33
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,360
has been an outspoken critic of those

34
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,040
people in the AI Community who warn

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,520
about the looming danger and existential

36
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,200
threat of AGI he believes the AGI will

37
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,399
be created one day but it will be good

38
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:48,040
it will not Escape human control nor

39
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,240
will it Dominate and kill all humans at

40
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,280
this moment of Rapid AI development this

41
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,759
happens to be somewhat a controversial

42
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,000
position and so it's been fun seeing Yan

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,680
get into a lot of intense and

44
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,759
fascinating discussions

45
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,679
online as we do in this very

46
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:10,360
conversation this is the lexman podcast

47
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,920
to support it please check out our

48
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,480
sponsors in the description and now dear

49
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,920
friends here's Yan

50
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,239
laon you've had some strong

51
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,640
statements technical statements about

52
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,440
the future of artificial intelligence

53
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,920
recently throughout your career actually

54
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:30,080
but recently as well uh you've said that

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,680
autoaggressive llms are uh not the way

56
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,040
we're going to make progress towards

57
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,560
superhuman intelligence these are the

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,080
large language models like GPT 4 like

59
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,720
llama 2 and 3 soon and so on how do they

60
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,519
work and why are they not going to take

61
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,040
us all the way for a number of reasons

62
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,000
the first is that there is a number of

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,400
characteristics of intelligent

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,440
behavior for example the capacity to

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,239
understand the world understand the

66
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,360
physical world

67
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,640
the ability to remember and retrieve

68
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,360
things um persistent memory the ability

69
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,480
to reason and the ability to plan those

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,599
are four essential characteristic of

71
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,040
intelligent um systems or entities

72
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,440
humans

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,400
animals lnms can do none of those or

74
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,480
they can only do them in a very

75
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,760
primitive way and uh they don't really

76
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,920
understand the physical world don't

77
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,599
really have persistent memory they can't

78
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,439
really reason and they certainly can't

79
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,319
plan and so you know if if if you expect

80
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,239
the system to become intelligent just

81
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,200
you know without having the possibility

82
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,879
of doing those things you're making a

83
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,680
mistake that is not to say that auto

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,879
regressive LS are not useful they're

85
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,000
certainly

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,439
useful um that they're not interesting

87
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,640
that we can't build a whole ecosystem of

88
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,519
applications around them of course we

89
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,840
can but as a path towards human level

90
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,560
intelligence they're missing essential

91
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,000
components and then there is another

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
tidbit or or fact that I think is very

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,280
interesting those llms are trained on

94
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,040
enormous amounts of text basically the

95
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,560
entirety of all publicly available text

96
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,400
on the internet right that's

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,000
typically on the order of 10 to the 13

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,199
tokens each token is typically two byes

99
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,600
so that's two 10 to the 13 bytes as

100
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,800
training data it would take you or me

101
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,039
170,000 years to just read through this

102
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:39,479
at eight hours a day uh so it seems like

103
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,240
an enormous amount of knowledge right

104
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,120
that those systems can

105
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
accumulate

106
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,479
um but then you realize it's really not

107
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,720
that much data if you you talk to

108
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,600
developmental psychologist and they tell

109
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,639
you a four-year-old has been awake for

110
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
16,000 hours in his

111
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,080
life um

112
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,960
and the amount of information that has

113
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,199
uh reached the visual cortex of that

114
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,639
child in four

115
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:12,120
years um is about 10 to the 15 bytes and

116
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,280
you can compute this by estimating that

117
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:17,160
the optical nerve carry about 20 megab

118
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,560
megabytes per second roughly and so 10^

119
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,000
the 15 bytes for a four-year-old versus

120
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,400
2 * 10 to 13 bytes for 170,000 years

121
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,520
worth of reading what it tells you is

122
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,319
that uh through sensory input we see a

123
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:36,280
lot more information than we than we do

124
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,360
through

125
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,960
language and that despite our

126
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,240
intuition most of what we learn and most

127
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,680
of our knowledge is through our

128
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
observation and interaction with the

129
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,400
real world not through language

130
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,759
everything that we learn in the first

131
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,080
few years of life and uh certainly

132
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,960
everything that animals learn has

133
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,240
nothing to do with language so it would

134
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,520
be good to uh maybe push against some of

135
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,720
of the intuition behind what you're

136
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,759
saying

137
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,360
so it is true there's several orders of

138
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,080
magnitude more data coming into the

139
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,680
human

140
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,280
mind much faster and the human mind is

141
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,880
able to learn very quickly from that

142
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,440
filter the data very quickly you know

143
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,240
somebody might argue your comparison

144
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,680
between sensory data versus language

145
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,080
that language is already very compressed

146
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,680
it already contains a lot more

147
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,319
information than the bytes it takes to

148
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,360
store them if you compare it to visual

149
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,560
data so there's a lot of wisdom and

150
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,599
language there's words and the way we

151
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:34,680
stitch them together it already contains

152
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,360
a lot of information so is it possible

153
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,800
that language alone already has

154
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,039
enough wisdom and knowledge in there to

155
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,319
be able to from that language construct

156
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,080
a a world model and understanding of the

157
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
world an understanding of the physical

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,840
world that you're saying L LMS lack so

159
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,120
it's a big debate among uh philosophers

160
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,039
and also cognitive scientists like

161
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,639
whether intelligence needs to be

162
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,000
grounded in

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,840
reality uh I'm clearly in the camp that

164
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,800
uh yes uh intelligence cannot appear

165
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,800
without some grounding in uh some

166
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,199
reality doesn't need to be you know

167
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,840
physical reality could be simulated but

168
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,400
um but the environment is just much

169
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,919
richer than what you can express in

170
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,639
language language is a very approximate

171
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,240
representation of our percepts and our

172
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000
mental models right I mean there there's

173
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,440
a lot of tasks that we accomplish where

174
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,520
we manipulate uh a mental model of uh of

175
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,960
the situation at hand and that has

176
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
nothing to do with language everything

177
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,560
that's physical mechanical whatever when

178
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,240
we build something when we accomplish a

179
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,599
task model task of you know grabbing

180
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:51,560
something Etc we plan or action

181
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,360
sequences and we do this by essentially

182
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,400
Imagining the result of the outcome of

183
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
sequence of actions so we might

184
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,960
imagine and that requires mental models

185
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,000
that don't have much to do with language

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,120
and that's I would argue most of our

187
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,039
knowledge is derived from that

188
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,960
interaction with the physical world so a

189
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,919
lot of a lot of my my colleagues who are

190
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,840
more uh interested in things like

191
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,560
computer vision are really on that camp

192
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,000
that uh AI needs to be embodied

193
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,639
essentially and then other people coming

194
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,400
from the NLP side or maybe you know some

195
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,880
some other uh motivation don't

196
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,000
necessarily agree with that um and

197
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,640
philosophers are split as well uh and

198
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,399
the U the complexity of the world is

199
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,240
hard to um hard to imagine it you know

200
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,279
it's hard to represent uh all the

201
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,040
complexities that we take completely for

202
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,760
granted in the real world that we don't

203
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,600
even imagine require intelligence right

204
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,600
this is the old marac Paradox from the

205
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,720
pioneer of Robotics and SMC we said you

206
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,200
know how is it that with computers it

207
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,360
seems to be easy to do high Lev complex

208
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,600
tasks like playing chess and solving

209
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,079
integrals and doing things like that

210
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:12,120
whereas the thing we take for granted

211
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,600
that we do every day um like I don't

212
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,839
know learning to drive a car or you know

213
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,560
grabbing an object we can do as

214
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:23,079
computers um

215
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,440
and you know we have llms that can pass

216
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,360
pass the bar exam so they must be smart

217
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,519
but then they can't learn to drive in 20

218
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,920
hours like any 17y old they can't learn

219
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,440
to clear out the dinner table and F of

220
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,079
the dishwasher like any 10-year-old can

221
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:44,240
learn in one shot um why is that like

222
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,120
you know what what are we missing what

223
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,920
what type of learning or or reasoning

224
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,320
architecture or whatever are we missing

225
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,279
that um um basically prevent us from

226
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:58,440
from you know having level five sing

227
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Cars and domestic robots can a large

228
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,480
language model construct a world model

229
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,000
that does know how to drive and does

230
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,480
know how to fill a dishwasher but just

231
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,959
doesn't know how to deal with visual

232
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,160
data at this time so it it can operate

233
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,279
in space of Concepts so yeah that's what

234
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:20,200
a lot of people are working on so the

235
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,640
answer the short answer is no and the

236
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,920
more complex sensor is you can use all

237
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,640
kind of tricks to get uh uh an llm to

238
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,399
basically digest U visual

239
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,320
representations of representations of

240
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,360
images uh or video or audio for that

241
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,880
matter um and uh a classical way of

242
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,279
doing this is uh you train a vision

243
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,880
system in some way and we have a number

244
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,440
of ways to train Vision systems either

245
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,639
supervised semisupervised self superise

246
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,680
all kinds of different ways uh that will

247
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,560
turn any image into

248
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,079
high level

249
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,200
representation basically a list of

250
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,000
tokens that are really similar to the

251
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,200
kind of tokens that

252
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,680
uh typical llm takes as an input and

253
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,240
then you just feed that to the llm in

254
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,279
addition to the text and you just expect

255
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,000
LM to kind of uh you know during

256
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,320
training to kind of be able to uh use

257
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,399
those representations to help make

258
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,320
decisions I mean there been work along

259
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,200
those line for for quite a long time um

260
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,639
and now you see those systems right I

261
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,680
mean there are llms that can that have

262
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,800
some Vision extension but they're

263
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,519
basically hacks in the sense that um

264
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,079
those things are not like trained end to

265
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:43,240
end to to handle to really understand

266
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,639
the world they're not trained with video

267
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,040
for example uh they don't really

268
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,160
understand intuitive physics at least

269
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,079
not at the moment so you don't think

270
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,360
there's something special to about

271
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,120
intuitive physics about sort of Common

272
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,279
Sense reasoning about the physical space

273
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,360
about physical reality that's that to

274
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,519
you is a giant leap that llms are just

275
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,240
not able to do we're not going to be

276
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,120
able to do this with the type of llms

277
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,800
that we are uh working with today and

278
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,680
there's a number of reasons for this but

279
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,360
uh the main reason

280
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,560
is the way llm LMS are trained is that

281
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,240
you you take a piece of text you remove

282
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,920
some of the words in that text you Mass

283
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,760
them you replace by replace them by

284
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,680
blank markers and you train a gtic

285
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,160
neural net to predict the words that are

286
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,760
missing uh and if you build this neural

287
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,800
net in a particular way so that it can

288
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,519
only look at u words that are to the

289
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,000
left of the one is trying to predict

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,480
then what you have is a system that

291
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,959
basically is trying to predict the next

292
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,480
word in a text right so then you can

293
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,079
feed it um a text a prompt and you can

294
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,959
ask it to predict the next word it can

295
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,120
never predict the next word exactly and

296
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,399
so what it's going to do is uh produce a

297
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,079
probability distribution over all the

298
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:55,040
possible words in your dictionary in

299
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,199
fact it doesn't predict words it

300
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,839
predicts tokens that are kind of subword

301
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,079
units and so it's easy to handle the

302
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,760
uncertainty in the prediction there

303
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,720
because there's only a finite number of

304
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,440
possible words in the dictionary and you

305
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,240
can just compute a distribution over

306
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,160
them um then what you what the system

307
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,519
does is that it it picks a word from

308
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,519
that distribution of course there's a

309
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,880
higher chance of picking words that have

310
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,800
a higher probability within that

311
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,160
distribution so you sample from that

312
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,160
distribution to actually produce a word

313
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,199
and then you shift that word into the

314
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:29,800
input and so that allows the system not

315
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,279
to predict the second word right and

316
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:33,920
once you do this you shift it into the

317
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,279
input Etc that's called Auto regressive

318
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,760
prediction and which is why those llms

319
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,320
should be called Auto regressive llms uh

320
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
but we just call them

321
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,920
LMS

322
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,160
and there is a difference between this

323
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,920
kind of process and a process by which

324
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,199
before producing a word when you talk

325
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,199
when you and I talk you and I are

326
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,240
bilinguals M we think think about what

327
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,399
we're going to say and it's relatively

328
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,720
independent of the language in which

329
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,199
we're going to say when we when we talk

330
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,160
about like uh I don't know let's say a

331
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,040
mathematical concept or something the

332
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,880
kind of thinking that we're doing and

333
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,120
the answer that we're planning to

334
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,880
produce is not linked to whether we're

335
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,399
going to see it in French or Russian or

336
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,279
English chsky just rolled his eyes but I

337
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,959
understand so you're saying that there's

338
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,399
a a bigger abstraction that repes that's

339
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,040
uh that goes before language yeah maps

340
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,639
onto language right it's certainly true

341
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,880
for a lot of thinking that we that we do

342
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,120
is that obvious that we don't like

343
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,639
you're saying your thinking is same in

344
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,720
French as it is in English yeah pretty

345
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,959
much yeah pretty much or is this like

346
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:46,079
how how flexible are you like if if

347
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,079
there's a probability

348
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,000
distribution well it it depends what

349
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,839
kind of thinking right if it's just uh

350
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:54,639
if it's like producing puns I get much

351
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:56,880
better in French than English about that

352
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,240
no but so worse is an abstract

353
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,880
representation of puns like is your

354
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,360
humor an abstract like when you tweet

355
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,720
and your tweets are sometimes a little

356
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,880
bit spicy uh what's is there an abstract

357
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,680
representation in your brain of a tweet

358
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,120
before it maps onto English there is an

359
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,880
abstract representation of uh Imagining

360
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,639
the reaction of a reader to that uh text

361
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,160
or you start with laughter and then

362
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,040
figure out how to make that happen or

363
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,079
figure out like a reaction you want to

364
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:26,959
cause and and then figure out how to say

365
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,040
it right so that it causes that reaction

366
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,720
but that's like really close to language

367
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,319
but think about like a math mathematical

368
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:36,440
concept or um you know imagining you

369
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,800
know something you want to build out of

370
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,079
wood or something like this right the

371
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,240
kind of thinking you're doing has

372
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,720
absolutely nothing to do with language

373
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,279
really like it's not like you have

374
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,240
necessarily like an internal monologue

375
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,519
in any particular language you're you're

376
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:51,360
you know imagining mental models of of

377
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,079
the thing right I mean if I if I ask you

378
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,560
to like imagine what this uh water

379
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,959
bottle will look like if I rotate it 90

380
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,199
degrees

381
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,480
um that has nothing to do with

382
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,319
language and so uh so clearly there is

383
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,800
you know a more abstract level of

384
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,680
representation uh in which we we do most

385
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,319
of our thinking and we plan what we're

386
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,240
going to say if the output is

387
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,720
is you know uttered words as opposed to

388
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,639
an output being uh you know muscle

389
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,800
actions right um we we plan our answer

390
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,120
before we produce it and LMS don't do

391
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,279
that they just produce one word after

392
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:35,160
the other instinctively if you want it's

393
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,440
like it's a bit like the you know

394
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,800
subconscious uh actions where you don't

395
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,120
like you're distracted you're doing

396
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,000
something you're completely concentrated

397
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,360
and someone comes to you and you know

398
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,720
asks you a question and you kind of

399
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,319
answer the question you don't have time

400
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:51,839
to think about the answer but the answer

401
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,120
is easy so you don't need to pay

402
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,040
attention you sort of respond

403
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,240
automatically that's kind of what an llm

404
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,360
does right it doesn't think about it

405
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,279
sensor really uh it retrieves it because

406
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,520
it's accumulated a lot of knowledge so

407
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,160
it can retrieve some some things but

408
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
it's going

409
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,480
to just spit out one token after the

410
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,559
other without planning the answer but

411
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,520
you're making it sound just one token

412
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,839
after the other one token at a time

413
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:24,240
generation is uh bound to be

414
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,799
simplistic but if the world model is

415
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,840
sufficiently sophisticated that one

416
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,400
token at a

417
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,760
time the the most likely thing it

418
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,480
generates is a sequence of tokens is

419
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,400
going to be a deeply profound thing okay

420
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,720
but then that assumes that those systems

421
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,760
actually possess an internal World model

422
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,000
so it really goes to the I I think the

423
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,960
fundamental question is can you build a

424
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,919
a

425
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,880
really complete World model not complete

426
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,159
but a uh one that has a deep

427
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,840
understanding of the world yeah so can

428
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,600
you build this first of all by

429
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,840
prediction right and the answer is

430
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,960
probably yes can you predict can you

431
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,880
build it by predicting words and the

432
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,960
answer is most probably no because

433
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,799
language is very poor in terms or weak

434
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,400
or low bandwidth if you want there's

435
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,520
just not enough information there so

436
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,480
building World models means observing

437
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,240
the

438
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,960
world and uh

439
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,280
understanding why the world is evolving

440
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,520
the way the way it is and then uh the

441
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,679
the extra component of a world model is

442
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,720
something that can predict how the world

443
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,520
is going to evolve as a consequence of

444
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,799
an action you might take right so what

445
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,919
model really is here is my idea of the

446
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,520
state of the world at time te here is an

447
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,240
action I might take what is the

448
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,679
predicted state of the world at Mt plus1

449
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,039
now that state of the world doesn't does

450
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,840
not need to represent everything about

451
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,280
the world it just needs to represent

452
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,600
enough that's relevant for this planning

453
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,039
of of the action but not necessarily all

454
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,159
the details now here is the problem um

455
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:12,000
you're not going to be able to do this

456
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,679
with generative models so genery model

457
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,320
has trained on video and we've tried to

458
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,280
do this for 10 years you take a video

459
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,640
show a system a piece of video and then

460
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,840
ask you to predict the reminder of the

461
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,320
video basically predict what's going to

462
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,840
happen one frame at a time do the same

463
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,080
thing as sort of the autoaggressive llms

464
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,520
do but for video right either one FR at

465
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,840
a time or a group of friends at a time

466
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,600
um but yeah uh a large video model if

467
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,240
you

468
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,480
want uh the idea of of doing this has

469
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,360
been floating around for a long time and

470
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,080
at at Fair uh some colleagues and I have

471
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,039
been trying to do this for about 10

472
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,760
years um and you can't you can't really

473
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,720
do the same trick as with LM because uh

474
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,440
you know llms as I said you can't

475
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,480
predict exactly which word is going to

476
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,120
follow a sequence of words we can

477
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,919
predict the distribution over words now

478
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,039
if you go to video what you would have

479
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,679
to do is predict the distribution over

480
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,600
all possible frames in a video and we

481
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,520
don't really know how to do that

482
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,080
properly uh we we do not know how to

483
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,880
represent distributions over High

484
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,919
dimensional continuous spaces in ways

485
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:26,039
that are

486
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,760
useful uh and and that's that there lies

487
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,760
the main issue and the reason we can do

488
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,600
this is because the world is incredibly

489
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,559
more complicated and richer in terms of

490
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,880
information than than text text is

491
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,159
discret video is high dimensional and

492
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,200
continuous a lot of details in this um

493
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,080
so if I take a a video of this room uh

494
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,520
and the video is you know a camera

495
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,320
panning around MH um there is no way I

496
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,520
can predict everything that's going to

497
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,080
be in the room as I pan around the

498
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,400
system cannot predict what's going to be

499
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,320
in the room as the camera is panning

500
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,440
maybe it's going to predict this is this

501
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,799
is a room where there's a light and

502
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,320
there is a wall and things like that it

503
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,919
can't predict what the painting on the

504
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,480
wall looks like or what the texture of

505
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,960
the couch looks like certainly not the

506
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,400
texture of the carpet so there's no way

507
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,240
I can predict all those details so the

508
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
the way to handle this is one way

509
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,480
possibly to handle this which we've been

510
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,200
working for a long time is to have a

511
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,640
model that has

512
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,880
what's called a latent variable and the

513
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,120
latent variable is fed to an Nal net and

514
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,679
it's supposed to represent all the

515
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:35,840
information about the world that you

516
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,440
don't perceive yet and uh that you need

517
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,320
to

518
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,440
augment uh the the system for the

519
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,200
prediction to do a good job at

520
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,679
predicting pixels including the you know

521
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:51,919
fine texture of the of the carpet and

522
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,400
the on a couch and and the painting on

523
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,880
the wall

524
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,120
um uh that has been a complete failure

525
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,880
essentially and we've tried lots of

526
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,520
things we tried uh just straight neural

527
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,600
Nets we tried Gans we tried uh you know

528
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,000
Vees all kinds of regularized Auto

529
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,240
encoders we tried um many things we also

530
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,640
tried those kind of methods to learn uh

531
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,120
good representations of images or video

532
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,279
um that could then be used as input to

533
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,000
for example an image classification

534
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,840
system mhm and that also was basically

535
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,919
failed like all the systems that attempt

536
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,880
to predict missing parts of an image or

537
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,159
video um you know from a corrupted

538
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:40,880
version of it basically so right take an

539
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,600
image or a video corrupt it or transform

540
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,679
it in some way and then try to

541
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:47,440
reconstruct the complete video or image

542
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,679
from the corrupted

543
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,120
version and then hope that internally

544
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,559
the system will develop a good

545
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,200
representations of images that you can

546
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,520
use for object recognition segmentation

547
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,640
whatever it is

548
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,720
is that has been essentially a complete

549
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,960
failure and it works really well for

550
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,640
text that's the principle that is used

551
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,760
for LMS right so where is the failure

552
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,520
exactly is that that it's very difficult

553
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,559
to form a good representation of an

554
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,559
image a good in like a good embedding of

555
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,840
all all the important information in the

556
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,000
image is it in terms of the consistency

557
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,679
of image to image to image the image

558
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:25,080
that forms the video like where what are

559
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,400
the if we do a highlight reel of all the

560
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,080
ways you failed what what's that look

561
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,600
like okay so the reason this doesn't

562
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,039
work uh is first of all I have to tell

563
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,640
you exactly what doesn't work because

564
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,840
there is something else that does work

565
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,520
uh so the thing that does not work is

566
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,720
training a system to learn

567
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,559
representations of images by training it

568
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,159
to

569
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,279
reconstruct uh a good image from a

570
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:54,320
corrupted version of it okay that's what

571
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,520
doesn't work and we have a whole slew of

572
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,640
technique for this uh that are you know

573
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,720
variant of ding Auto encoders something

574
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,559
called Mee developed by some of my

575
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,039
colleagues at Fair Max Doo encoder so

576
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,559
it's basically like

577
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,799
the you know llms or or or or things

578
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:13,159
like this where you train the system by

579
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:14,679
corrupting text except you corrupt

580
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:16,600
images you remove Patches from it and

581
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,360
you train a gigantic neet to reconstruct

582
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,039
the features you get are not good and

583
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,559
you know they're not good because if you

584
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:25,559
now train the same architecture but you

585
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:28,720
train it supervised mhm with with uh

586
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,799
label data with Tex textual descriptions

587
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:34,640
of images Etc you do get good

588
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,039
representations and the performance on

589
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,120
recognition tasks is much better than if

590
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,480
you do this self-supervised free trining

591
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,520
so the architecture is good the

592
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,760
architecture is good the architecture of

593
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,399
the encoder is good okay but the fact

594
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:50,320
that you train the system to reconstruct

595
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,720
images does not lead it to produce to

596
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,159
learn good generic features of images

597
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,159
when you train in a self-supervised way

598
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,559
self-supervised by reconstruction Yeah

599
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,320
by reconstruction okay so what's the

600
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:06,480
alternative the alternative is joint

601
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,919
embedding what is joint embedding what

602
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:10,159
are what are these architectures that

603
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,880
you're so excited about okay so now

604
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,080
instead of training a system to encode

605
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
the image and then training it to

606
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,440
reconstruct the the full image from a

607
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,640
corrupted version you take the full

608
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,600
image you take

609
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,399
the corrupted or transformed version you

610
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,480
run them both through encoders mhm which

611
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,559
in general are identical but not

612
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,159
necessarily and then you you

613
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,760
train a predictor on top of those uh

614
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,720
encoders um to predict the

615
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,080
representation of the full input from

616
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,840
the representation of the corrupted

617
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,159
one okay so joint embedding because

618
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:51,039
you're you're taking the the full input

619
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,240
and the corrupted version or transform

620
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
version run them both through encoders

621
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,399
so you get a joint embedding and then

622
00:25:57,399 --> 00:25:59,480
you and then you're you're saying can I

623
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,720
predict the representation of the full

624
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,039
one from the representation of the

625
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,360
corrupted one okay um and I call this a

626
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,840
JEA so that means joint embedding

627
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,520
predictive architecture because it's

628
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,679
joint embedding and there is this

629
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,720
predictor that predicts the

630
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,559
representation of the good guy from from

631
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,600
the bad

632
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,520
guy um and the big question is how do

633
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,120
you train something like this uh and

634
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,880
until five years ago or six years ago we

635
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,159
didn't have particularly good answers

636
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,000
for how you train those things except

637
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,919
for one um called contrastive

638
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:32,480
contrastive

639
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,080
learning

640
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,200
where um and the IDE contrastive

641
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,240
learning is you you take a pair of

642
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,520
images that are again an image and a

643
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,760
corrupted version or degraded version

644
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,520
somehow or transform version of the

645
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,279
original one and you train the predicted

646
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,799
representation to be the same as as that

647
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:53,880
if you only do this the system collapses

648
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,279
it basically completely ignores the

649
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,240
input and produces representations that

650
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,600
are con

651
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,840
so the contrastive methods avoid this

652
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,159
and and those things have been around

653
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,080
since the early 90s had a paper on this

654
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,720
in

655
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,200
1993 um is you also show pairs of images

656
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,120
that you know are different and then you

657
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,200
push away the representations from each

658
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,080
other so you say not only do

659
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,799
representations of things that we know

660
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,760
are the same should be the same or

661
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
should be similar but representation of

662
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,840
things that we know are different should

663
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,520
be

664
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,919
different and that prevents the collapse

665
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,399
but it has some limitation and there's a

666
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,279
whole bunch of uh techniques that have

667
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,440
appeared over the last six seven years

668
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,880
um that can revive this this type of

669
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,600
method um some of them from Far some of

670
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,080
them from from Google and other places

671
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,320
um but there are limitations to those

672
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,120
contrasting method what has changed in

673
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,679
the last

674
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,039
uh you know three four years is now now

675
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,720
we have methods that are non-contrastive

676
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,840
so they don't require those negative

677
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,360
contractive samples of images that are

678
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
that we know are different you can only

679
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,320
you turn them only with images that are

680
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,640
you know different versions or different

681
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,880
views of the same thing uh and you rely

682
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,240
on some other tricks to prevent the

683
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,519
system from collapsing and we have have

684
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,039
a dozen different methods for this now

685
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,880
so what is the fundamental difference

686
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,840
between joint embedding architectures

687
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,240
and llms so can uh can japa take us to

688
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,399
AGI whether we should say that you don't

689
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:32,320
like uh the term AGI and we'll probably

690
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,360
argue I think every single time I've

691
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,000
talked to you with argued about the G

692
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,480
and AGI yes get I get it I get it we

693
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,080
we'll probably continue to argue about

694
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,480
it it's great uh you you like uh I me

695
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,200
this because cuz you like French and um

696
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,039
I me is is is uh I guess friend in

697
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,360
French yes and Ami stands for advanced

698
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,000
machine intelligence right um but either

699
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,799
way can japa take us to that towards

700
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,799
that advanced machine intelligence well

701
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,080
so it's a it's a first step okay so

702
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,880
first of all uh what What's the

703
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,440
difference with generative architectures

704
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,880
like llms um so llms um

705
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,640
or Vision systems that are trained by

706
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,960
reconstruction generate the inputs right

707
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,080
they generate the original input that is

708
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,919
non-corrupted

709
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,720
non-transformed right so you have to

710
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,840
predict all the

711
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,880
pixels and there is a huge amount of

712
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,559
resources spent in the system to

713
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:35,000
actually predict all those pixels all

714
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,080
the

715
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,360
details uh in a jepa you're not trying

716
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,120
to predict all the pixels you're only

717
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,039
trying to predict an abstract

718
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,960
representation of of the inputs right

719
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,640
and that's much easier in many ways so

720
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,039
what the japa system when it's being

721
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,279
trained is trying to do is extract as

722
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,120
much information as possible from the

723
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,159
input but yet only EXT ract information

724
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,799
that is relatively easily

725
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,039
predictable okay so there's a lot of

726
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,159
things in the world that we cannot

727
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,960
predict like for example if you have a s

728
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,559
driving car driving down the street or

729
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,760
road uh there may be uh trees around the

730
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,440
around the road and it could be a windy

731
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,600
day so the the leaves on the tree are

732
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,000
kind of moving in kind of semi chaotic

733
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,039
random ways that you can't predict and

734
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,679
you don't care you don't want to predict

735
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,399
so what you want is your encoder to

736
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:27,320
basically eliminate all those details

737
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,840
will tell you there's moving leaves but

738
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,120
it's not going to keep the details of

739
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,720
exactly what's going on um and so when

740
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,559
you do the prediction in representation

741
00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:36,880
space you're not going to have to

742
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,840
predict every single Pixel of a

743
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:42,840
relief and that you know um not only is

744
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,279
a lot simpler but also it allows the

745
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,039
system to essentially learn an abstract

746
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:50,559
representation of of the world where you

747
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,480
know what can be modeled and predicted

748
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,919
is preserved and the rest is viewed as

749
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,240
noise and eliminated by the encoder so

750
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,360
it kind of lifts the level of

751
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,480
abstraction of the representation if you

752
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,840
think about this this is something we do

753
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,880
absolutely all the time whenever we

754
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,760
describe a phenomenon we describe it at

755
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,279
a particular level of abstraction and we

756
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:12,840
don't always describe every natural

757
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,639
phenomenon in terms of quantum field

758
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:17,279
Theory right that would be impossible

759
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,440
right so we have multiple levels of

760
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,039
abstraction to describe what happens in

761
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,480
the world you know starting from Quantum

762
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,720
field Theory to like atomic theory and

763
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,120
molecules you know in chemistry

764
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,320
materials and you know all the way up to

765
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,880
you know kind of concrete objects in the

766
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,240
real world and things like that so the

767
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,279
we we can't just only model everything

768
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,840
at the lowest level and that that's what

769
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,120
the idea of JEA is really on is really

770
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:48,039
about learn abstract representation in a

771
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,320
self-supervised uh Manner and you know

772
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,600
you can do it hierarchically as well so

773
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
that I think is an essential component

774
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,960
of an intelligent system and in language

775
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,519
we can get away without doing this

776
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,399
because language is already to some

777
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,760
level abstract and already has

778
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,679
eliminated a lot of information that is

779
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,320
not predictable and um so we can get

780
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,720
away without doing the tring without you

781
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,919
know lifting the abstraction level and

782
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,840
by directly predicting words so joint

783
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,399
embedding it's still generative but it's

784
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,240
generative in this abstract

785
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,360
representation space yeah and you're

786
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,760
saying language we were lazy with

787
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,799
language cuz we already got the abstract

788
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,880
representation for free and now we have

789
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,720
to zoom out actually think about

790
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,960
generally intelligent systems we have

791
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:38,720
to deal with a full mess of physical

792
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,360
reality of reality and you can't you you

793
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,519
do have to do this step of jumping

794
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:51,279
from uh the full Rich detailed reality

795
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,919
to a uh abstract representation of that

796
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,880
reality based on which you can then

797
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,679
reason and all that kind of stuff right

798
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,000
and the thing is those cell supervised

799
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,080
algorithm that that learn by

800
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,399
prediction even in representation space

801
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:09,919
uh they learn more uh concept if the

802
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,279
input data you Feit them is more

803
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,279
redundant the more redundancy there is

804
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,880
in the data the more they're able to

805
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,720
capture some internal structure of it

806
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,799
and so there there is way more

807
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,519
redundancy in structure in perceptual uh

808
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,440
inputs sensory input like like like

809
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,559
Vision than there is in

810
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:30,000
uh text which is not nearly as redundant

811
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,320
this is back to the question you were

812
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,960
asking a few minutes ago language might

813
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,480
represent more information really

814
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,840
because it's already compressed you're

815
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,039
you're right about that but that means

816
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:41,600
it's also less redundant and so self

817
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,279
supervision will not work as well is it

818
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:48,840
possible to join the self-supervised

819
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,760
training on visual data and

820
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,960
self-supervised training on language

821
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,399
data there is a huge amount of knowledge

822
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,360
even though you talk down about those 10

823
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,120
to the 13 tokens those 10 to the 13

824
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,360
tokens represent the

825
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,880
entirety a large fraction of what US

826
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,800
humans have figured out both the

827
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,399
talk on Reddit and the contents of all

828
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,000
the books and the Articles and the full

829
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,239
spectrum of

830
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,480
human uh intellectual creation so is it

831
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,440
possible to join those two together well

832
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,079
eventually yes but I think uh if we do

833
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,719
this too early

834
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,879
we run the risk of being tempted to

835
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,280
cheat and in fact that's what people are

836
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,159
doing at the moment with vision language

837
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,839
model we're basically cheating we are

838
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,040
using uh language as a crutch to help

839
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,520
the deficiencies of our uh Vision

840
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,918
systems to kind of learn good

841
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,480
representations from uh images and video

842
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,440
and uh the problem with this is that we

843
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,399
might you know improve our uh visual

844
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,040
language system a bit I mean our

845
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,560
language models by you know feeding them

846
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,000
image

847
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,520
but we're not going to get to the level

848
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,680
of even the intelligence or level of

849
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,560
understanding of the world of a cat or

850
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,480
dog which doesn't have language you know

851
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,440
they don't have language and they

852
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,560
understand the world much better than

853
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,960
any llm they can plan really complex

854
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,240
actions and sort of imagine the result

855
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,760
of a bunch of actions how do we get

856
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,040
machines to learn that before we combine

857
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,560
that with language obviously if we

858
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,000
combine this with language this is going

859
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,320
to be a winner um but but before that we

860
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,280
have to focus on like how do we get

861
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,400
systems to learn how the world works so

862
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,240
this kind of joint embedding predictive

863
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,160
architecture for you that's going to be

864
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,800
able to learn something like Common

865
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,480
Sense something like what a cat uses to

866
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,599
predict how to mess with its owner most

867
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,960
optimally by knocking over a thing

868
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:52,119
that's that's the Hope in fact the

869
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,079
techniques we're using are

870
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:55,920
non-contrastive uh so not only is the

871
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,599
architecture non generative the learning

872
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:00,480
procedures we're using are non

873
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,720
contrastive we have two two sets of

874
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,880
techniques one set is based on

875
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,480
distillation and there's a number of uh

876
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,400
methods that use this principle uh one

877
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,359
by Deep Mind

878
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:15,880
Bol a couple by by Fair one one called

879
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,960
uh

880
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,040
VRA and another one called IA and vcra I

881
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,200
should say is not a distillation method

882
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,319
actually but IA and B certainly are and

883
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,160
there's another one also called Dino or

884
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,839
dyo also produced from at fair and the

885
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,040
idea of those things is that you take

886
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,720
the full input let's say an image uh you

887
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,920
run it through an

888
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,359
encoder uh produces a representation and

889
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,119
then you corrupt that input or transform

890
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,040
it running to the essentially what

891
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,680
amounts to the same encoder with some

892
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,480
minor

893
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,480
differences and then train a predictor

894
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,839
sometimes to predictor is very simple

895
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:53,400
sometime doesn't exist but train a

896
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,280
predictor to predict a representation of

897
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,480
the first first uh uncorrupted input

898
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,599
from the corrupted input um but you only

899
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:05,680
train the the second Branch um you only

900
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,440
train the part of the network that is

901
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,119
fed with the corrupted input the other

902
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,920
network you don't you don't train but

903
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,280
since they share the same weight when

904
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,200
you modify the first one it also

905
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,960
modifies the second one uh and with

906
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,240
various tricks you can prevent the

907
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,800
system from collapsing uh with the

908
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,319
collapse of the type I was explaining

909
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:25,400
before where the system basically

910
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,480
ignores the input

911
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,440
um so that works very well the the

912
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,200
technique with the two techniques we

913
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,319
develop at Fair uh dino and uh and IA

914
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:39,800
work really well for that so what kind

915
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,200
of data are we talking about here so

916
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,359
this the several scenario one uh one

917
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:47,880
scenario is you take an image you

918
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,520
corrupt it by um changing the cropping

919
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,040
for example changing the size a little

920
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,640
bit maybe changing the orientation

921
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,359
blurring it changing the colors doing

922
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,160
all kinds of horrible things to it but

923
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,200
basic horrible things basic horrible

924
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,640
things that sort of degrade the quality

925
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,000
a little bit and change the framing uh

926
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,720
you know crop the image um or and in

927
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,160
some cases in the case of a JEA you

928
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,520
don't need to do any of this you just

929
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,400
you just mask some parts of it right you

930
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,480
just basically remove some regions like

931
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,880
a big block

932
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,319
essentially and and then you know run

933
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:25,680
through the encoders um and train the

934
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,800
entire system and and predictor to

935
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,200
predict the representation of the good

936
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,560
one from the representation of the

937
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,520
corrupted

938
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,000
one um so that's the Ia doesn't need to

939
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,280
know that it's an image for example

940
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,480
because the only thing it needs to know

941
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,680
is how to do this masking um whereas

942
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,319
with doo you need to know it's an image

943
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:45,920
because you need to do things like you

944
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
know geometri transformation and

945
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,400
blurring and things like that that are

946
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,680
really image

947
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:53,160
specific uh a more recent version of of

948
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,800
this that we have is called V JEA so is

949
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,160
basically the same idea as I except um

950
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,640
it's applied to video so now you take a

951
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,640
whole video and you mask a whole chunk

952
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,839
of it and what we mask is actually kind

953
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,720
of a temple tube so an all like a whole

954
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,560
uh segment of each frame in the video

955
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,920
over the entire video and that tube was

956
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,640
like statically position throughout the

957
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,079
frames lit straight tube the tube yeah

958
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:18,960
typically is 16 frames or something and

959
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,240
we mask the same region over the entire

960
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,720
16 frames it's a different one for every

961
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:27,079
video obviously and um and then again

962
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:29,800
train that system so as to predict the

963
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,599
representation of the full video from

964
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,319
The partially matched video uh that

965
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:36,000
works really well it's the first system

966
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,680
that we have that learns good

967
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,319
representations of video so that when

968
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:42,720
you feed those representations to a

969
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,480
supervised uh classifier head it can it

970
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,960
can tell you what action is taking place

971
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,880
in the video with you know pretty good

972
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,599
accuracy um so that that's it's the

973
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,839
first time we get something of that uh

974
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:56,680
of that quality so that that's a a good

975
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,280
test that a good representation is

976
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,680
formed that means there's something to

977
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,480
this yeah um we also preliminary result

978
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,599
that seem to indicate that the

979
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,480
representation allows us allow our

980
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,319
system to tell whether the video is

981
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:13,280
physically possible or completely

982
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,680
impossible because some object

983
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,839
disappeared or an object you know

984
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:18,560
suddenly jumped from one location to

985
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,760
another or or change shape or something

986
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,640
so it's able to capture some physical

987
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,520
con some physic based constraints about

988
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,280
the reality represented in the video

989
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,319
yeah about the appearance and The

990
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:34,359
Disappearance of objects yeah that's

991
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:39,119
really you okay but C can this

992
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,560
actually get us to this kind of uh World

993
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,880
model

994
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,040
that understands enough about the world

995
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:50,240
to be able to drive a car uh possibly um

996
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,880
this is going to take a while before we

997
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,640
get to that point but um um and there

998
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,440
are systems already you know everybody

999
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,560
systems that are based on this uh idea

1000
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,119
uh and the what you need for this is a

1001
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,560
slightly modified version of this where

1002
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,760
um imagine that you

1003
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,520
have uh a video and the a complete video

1004
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,079
and what you're doing to this video is

1005
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,040
that you're either translating it in

1006
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,960
time towards the future so you only see

1007
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,280
the beginning of the video but you don't

1008
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,520
see the latter part of it that is in the

1009
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:25,520
original one or you just mask the second

1010
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,200
half of the video for example um and

1011
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,119
then you you train a JEA system of the

1012
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,720
type I describe to predict the

1013
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,200
representation of the full video from

1014
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,480
the the shifted one but you also feed

1015
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,440
the predictor with an action for example

1016
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,760
you know the wheel is turned 10 degrees

1017
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,480
to the to the right or something right

1018
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,880
so if it's a you know a dash cam in a

1019
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,280
car and you know the angle of the wheel

1020
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,560
you should be able to predict to some

1021
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,160
extent what's going what's going to go

1022
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,560
what's going to happen to which to see

1023
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,760
uh you're not going to be able to

1024
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,599
predict all the details of you know

1025
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,240
objects that appear in the view

1026
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,839
obviously but at a abstract

1027
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,680
representation level you can you can

1028
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,599
probably predict what's going to happen

1029
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:10,520
so now what you have

1030
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:13,560
is a internal model that says here is my

1031
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,200
idea of state of the world at time T

1032
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,160
here is an action I'm taking here's a

1033
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,400
prediction of the state of the world at

1034
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,599
time t plus one t plus Delta t t plus 2

1035
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:24,720
seconds whatever it is if you have a

1036
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,000
model of this type you can use it for

1037
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,319
planning so now you can do what llms

1038
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:32,920
cannot do which is planning what you're

1039
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,640
going to do so as to arrive at a

1040
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,680
particular uh outcome or satisfy a

1041
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,160
particular objective right so you can

1042
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,160
have a number of

1043
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,200
objectives um right if you know I can I

1044
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,720
can predict that uh if I have uh an

1045
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,800
object like this right and I open my

1046
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:55,960
hand it's going to fall right and uh and

1047
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,599
if if I push it with a particular force

1048
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,040
on the table it's going to move if I

1049
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,480
push the table itself it's probably not

1050
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,559
going to move uh with the same Force um

1051
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:06,000
so we have we have this internal model

1052
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,720
of the world in our in our mind uh which

1053
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,680
allows us to plan sequences of actions

1054
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,559
to arrive at a particular goal um and so

1055
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,559
um so now if you have this world model

1056
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:21,559
we can imagine a sequence of actions

1057
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:23,160
predict what the outcome of the sequence

1058
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,839
of action is going to be measure to what

1059
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:26,680
extent

1060
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:30,000
the final State satisfies a particular

1061
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,000
objective like you know moving the

1062
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,079
bottle to the left of the

1063
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,000
table um and then plan a sequence of

1064
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,920
actions that will minimize this

1065
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,800
objective at run time we're not talking

1066
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,040
about learning we're talking about

1067
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,040
inference time right so this is planning

1068
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,480
really and in optimal control this is a

1069
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,200
very classical thing it's called Uh

1070
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,480
model predictive control you have a

1071
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,760
model of the system you want to control

1072
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
that you know can predict the sequence

1073
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,319
of State St corresponding to a sequence

1074
00:43:57,319 --> 00:43:58,079
of

1075
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,720
commands and you're planning a sequence

1076
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,520
of commands so that according to your

1077
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,960
world model the the the end state of the

1078
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:09,800
system will uh satisfy an objectives

1079
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,200
that you fix this is the

1080
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,640
way uh you know rocket trajectories have

1081
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,359
been planned since computers have been

1082
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:19,040
around so since the early 60s

1083
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,400
essentially so yes for model predictive

1084
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,640
control but you also often talk about

1085
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,000
hierarchical planning can hierarchical

1086
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,119
planning emerge from this somehow well

1087
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,640
so no you you will have to build

1088
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,640
specific architecture to allow for

1089
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,079
hierarchical planning so hierarchical

1090
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:37,000
planning is absolutely necessary if you

1091
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,440
want to plan complex

1092
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,920
actions uh if I want to go from let's

1093
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,480
say from New York to Paris this the

1094
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,520
example I use all the time and I'm

1095
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,440
sitting uh in my office at NYU my

1096
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,599
objective that I need to minimize is my

1097
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:53,720
distance to Paris at a high level a very

1098
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,240
astract representation of my uh my

1099
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,280
location I would have to decompose this

1100
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,640
into two sub goals first one is um go to

1101
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,160
the airport second one is catch a plane

1102
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,400
to Paris okay so my sub goal is

1103
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,640
now uh going to the airport my objective

1104
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,520
function is my distance to the

1105
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,160
airport how do I go to the airport where

1106
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,160
I have to go in the street and H a taxi

1107
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,400
which you can do in New

1108
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,599
York um okay now I have another sub goal

1109
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:26,119
go down on the street uh well that means

1110
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:28,240
going to the elevator going down the

1111
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,280
elevator walk out the street how do I go

1112
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,960
to the elevator I have to

1113
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,760
uh stand up from my chair open the door

1114
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:39,359
of my office go to the elevator push

1115
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,440
push the button how do I get up from my

1116
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,359
chair like you know you can imagine

1117
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,880
going down all the way down to basically

1118
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,079
what amounts to millisecond by

1119
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,480
millisecond muscle

1120
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,599
control okay and obviously you're not

1121
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:55,200
going to plan your entire trip from New

1122
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,480
York to Paris

1123
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,559
in terms of millisecond by millisecond

1124
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:00,760
muscle control first that would be

1125
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,880
incredibly expensive but it will also be

1126
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,400
completely impossible because you don't

1127
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,800
know all the conditions of what's going

1128
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,000
to happen uh you know how long it's

1129
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,240
going to take to catch a taxi um or to

1130
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,119
go to the airport with traffic you know

1131
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,119
uh I mean you you would have to know

1132
00:46:16,119 --> 00:46:18,000
exactly the condition of everything to

1133
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,200
be able to do this planning and you

1134
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,280
don't have the information so you you

1135
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,040
have to do this hierarchical planning so

1136
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,960
that you can start acting and then sort

1137
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:29,800
of replanning as you go and nobody

1138
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,319
really knows how to do this in AI um

1139
00:46:33,319 --> 00:46:35,359
nobody knows how to train a system to

1140
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,800
learn the appropriate multiple levels of

1141
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,599
representation so that hierarchical

1142
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,040
planning Works does something like that

1143
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,640
already emerge so like can you use an

1144
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:49,240
llm state-ofthe-art llm to get you from

1145
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,160
New York to Paris by doing exactly the

1146
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,119
kind of detailed set of questions that

1147
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,480
you just did

1148
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,200
which is can you give me a highight a

1149
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:01,440
list of 10 steps I need to do to get

1150
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,160
from New York to Paris and then for each

1151
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,520
of those steps can you give me a list of

1152
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,240
10 steps how I make that step happen and

1153
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,800
for each of those steps can you give me

1154
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,920
a list of 10 steps to make each one of

1155
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,280
those until you're moving your mus

1156
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,200
individual muscles uh maybe not whatever

1157
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,559
you can actually act upon using your

1158
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,079
mind right so there's a lot of questions

1159
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,599
that are sort implied by this right so

1160
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:27,359
the first thing is llms will be able to

1161
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:29,040
answer some of those questions down to

1162
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,319
some level of

1163
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:33,200
exraction under the condition that

1164
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,079
they've been trained with similar

1165
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:37,400
scenarios in their training set they

1166
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:39,240
would be able to answer all those

1167
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,119
questions but some of them may be

1168
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:44,400
hallucinated meaning non-factual yeah

1169
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,720
true I mean they will probably produce

1170
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,000
some answer except they're not going to

1171
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,440
be able to really kind of produce

1172
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,839
millisecond by millisecond muscle

1173
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:51,839
control of how you how you stand up from

1174
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,599
your chair right so but down to some

1175
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:56,240
level of exraction we can describe

1176
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,559
things by words they might be able to

1177
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,359
give you a plan but only under the

1178
00:48:00,359 --> 00:48:01,480
condition that they've been trained to

1179
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,000
produce those kind of plans mhm right

1180
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,040
they're not going to be able to plan for

1181
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,200
situations where that that they never

1182
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:10,040
encountered before they basically are

1183
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,319
going to have to regurgitate the

1184
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:12,920
template that they've been trained on

1185
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,960
but where like just for the example of

1186
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,720
New York to Paris is is it going to

1187
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,319
start getting into trouble like at which

1188
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:21,680
layer layer of abstraction do you think

1189
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,440
you'll start cuz like I can imagine

1190
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,760
almost every single part of that anal

1191
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:26,839
will be able to answer somewhat

1192
00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:28,319
accurately especially when you're

1193
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,040
talking about New York and Paris major

1194
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:33,440
cities so I mean certainly uh LM would

1195
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,079
be able to solve that problem if you f

1196
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,040
tun need for it you know just uh and and

1197
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,119
so uh I can't say that nlm cannot do

1198
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,599
this it can do this if you train it for

1199
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:46,119
it there's no question uh down to a

1200
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:49,200
certain level where things can be

1201
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,599
formulated in terms of words but like if

1202
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:53,440
you want to go down to like how do you

1203
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,079
you know climb down the stairs or just

1204
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:57,160
stand up from your chair in terms of uh

1205
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,280
words like you you can't you can't do it

1206
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,599
um you you need that's one of the

1207
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:05,400
reasons you need experience of the

1208
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,079
physical world which is much higher

1209
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:08,880
bandwidth than what you can express in

1210
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,480
words in human language so everything

1211
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:12,920
we've been talking about on the joint

1212
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,760
embedding space is it possible that

1213
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,440
that's what we need for like the

1214
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,280
interaction with physical reality for on

1215
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,040
the robotics front and then just the

1216
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:24,359
llms are the thing that sits on top of

1217
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:27,680
it for the bigger reasoning about like

1218
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,720
yeah the fact that I need to book a

1219
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:31,880
plane ticket and I need to know I know

1220
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:34,119
how to go to the websites and so on sure

1221
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:36,280
and you know a lot of plans that people

1222
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,440
know about um that are relatively high

1223
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,359
level are actually learned they're not

1224
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,960
people most people don't invent the you

1225
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,400
know plans um uh they

1226
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,400
they by themselves they uh you know we

1227
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,480
have some ability to do this of course

1228
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,200
uh obviously but um but but most plants

1229
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,119
that people use are plants that they've

1230
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:00,200
been trained on like they've seen other

1231
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,559
people use those plants or they've been

1232
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:04,319
told how to do things right um that you

1233
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,599
can't invent how you like take a person

1234
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,799
who's never heard of airplanes and tell

1235
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:11,119
them like how do you go from New York to

1236
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:13,640
Paris and they're probably not going to

1237
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,319
be able to kind of you know deconstruct

1238
00:50:15,319 --> 00:50:16,960
the whole plan unless they've seen

1239
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,240
examples of that before um so certainly

1240
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,119
LMS are going to be able to do this but

1241
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,680
but then um how you link this from the

1242
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,280
the low level

1243
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,200
of of of actions uh that needs to be

1244
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,920
done with things like like Jad that

1245
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,799
basically lift the abstraction level of

1246
00:50:33,799 --> 00:50:35,440
the representation without attempting to

1247
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,079
reconstruct every detail of the

1248
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:40,799
situation that's why we need Jass for I

1249
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:43,480
would love to sort of Linger on your

1250
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,920
skepticism

1251
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:47,480
around uh autoaggressive

1252
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:51,040
llms so one way I would like to test

1253
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:53,680
that skepticism is everything you say

1254
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,440
makes a lot of sense

1255
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:00,520
but if I apply everything you said today

1256
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,559
and in general to like I don't know 10

1257
00:51:03,559 --> 00:51:05,640
years ago maybe a little bit less no

1258
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,280
let's say three years ago I wouldn't be

1259
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:09,559
able to

1260
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:14,160
predict the uh success of llms so does

1261
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,319
it make sense to you that autoaggressive

1262
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,720
llms are able to be so damn

1263
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,240
good yes can you explain your intuition

1264
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,280
because if I were to take your wisdom

1265
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,040
and

1266
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,559
intuition at face value I would say

1267
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,079
there's no way autoaggressive LMS one

1268
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:35,200
token at a time would be able to do the

1269
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,680
kind of things they're doing no there's

1270
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,160
one thing that auto llms uh or that llms

1271
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,040
in general not just the autoaggressive

1272
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,400
one but including the birth style bir

1273
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,920
directional ones uh are exploiting and

1274
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,440
it's self-supervised learning and I've

1275
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,280
been a very very strong advocate of self

1276
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,520
supervising for many years so those

1277
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,200
things are

1278
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,960
a incredibly impressive demonstration

1279
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,960
that cell supervisor learning actually

1280
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,680
works uh the idea that you know started

1281
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,240
uh it didn't start with with uh with

1282
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:08,720
Bert but it was really kind of a good

1283
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,799
demonstration with this so the

1284
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:13,440
the the idea that you know you take a

1285
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,720
piece of text you corrupt it and then

1286
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,240
you train some gigantic neural net to

1287
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,839
reconstruct the parts that are

1288
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:22,440
missing um that has been an enormous

1289
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,520
uh produced an enormous amount of

1290
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,079
benefits uh it allowed allowed us to

1291
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:29,760
create systems that understand

1292
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,200
understand language uh systems that can

1293
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,920
translate um hundreds of languages in

1294
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,040
any direction systems that are

1295
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,599
multilingual so they're not it's a

1296
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,040
single system that can be trained to

1297
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,200
understand hundreds of languages and

1298
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,559
translate in any

1299
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:48,640
direction um and produce summaries um

1300
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,640
and then answer questions and produce

1301
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,839
text and then there's a special case of

1302
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:55,240
it where you know you which is the auto

1303
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,880
Progressive uh trick where you constrain

1304
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,760
the system to not elaborate a

1305
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,799
representation of the text from looking

1306
00:53:02,799 --> 00:53:04,599
at the enti text but

1307
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,160
only predicting a word from the words

1308
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,880
that are come before right and you do

1309
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,400
this by the constraining the

1310
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,799
architecture of the network and that's

1311
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:13,839
what you can build an auto regressive

1312
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:17,000
ATM from so there was a surprise many

1313
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,559
years ago with what's called decoder

1314
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:22,599
only llm so since you know systems of

1315
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:24,559
this type that are just trying to

1316
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,040
produce uh words from the from the

1317
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,359
previous one and and the fact that when

1318
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,559
you scale them up they they tend

1319
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,079
to really kind of understand more about

1320
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:37,280
the about language when you train them

1321
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,680
on lot of data and you make them really

1322
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,839
big that was kind of a surprise and that

1323
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:42,760
surprise occurred quite a while back

1324
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:47,640
like you know uh with uh work from uh

1325
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,240
you know Google meta open AI Etc you

1326
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:53,520
know going back to you know the GPT kind

1327
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,880
of uh work General pre-train

1328
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:58,520
Transformers do you mean like gbt2 like

1329
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,760
there's a certain place where you start

1330
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,359
to realize scaling might actually keep

1331
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,839
giving us a an emergent benefit yeah I

1332
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:08,160
mean there were there were work from

1333
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,760
from various places but uh uh if if you

1334
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,680
want to kind of you know place it in the

1335
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,599
in the GPT uh timeline that would be

1336
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:20,319
around gpt2 yeah well I just cuz you

1337
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:22,520
said it you're you're so charismatic you

1338
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:24,599
said so many words but self-supervised

1339
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:27,359
learning yeah yes but again the same

1340
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:30,079
intuition you're applying to saying that

1341
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,440
autor regressive llms cannot have a deep

1342
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,599
understanding of the world if we just

1343
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:38,480
apply that same intuition does it make

1344
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,640
sense to you that they're able to form

1345
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,640
enough of a representation of the world

1346
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:46,280
to be damn convincing

1347
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,280
essentially passing the original touring

1348
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,160
test with flying colors well we're

1349
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,559
fooled by their fluency right we just

1350
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:56,520
assume that if a system is is fluent in

1351
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,880
manipulating language then it has all

1352
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,040
the characteristics of human

1353
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,040
intelligence but that impression is

1354
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,680
false we we we're really fooled by it um

1355
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,880
what do you think alen tan would say it

1356
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,319
without understanding anything just

1357
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,920
hanging out with it an Turing would

1358
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,440
decide that a Turing test is a really

1359
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,200
bad test okay this is what the AI

1360
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:18,799
Community has decided many years ago

1361
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,160
that the tring test was a really bad

1362
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,440
test of intelligence what would Hans

1363
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,319
marvac say about the about the large

1364
00:55:25,319 --> 00:55:27,359
language models hence Marv would say the

1365
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:31,359
Marv Paradox still applies okay okay

1366
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,799
okay we can pass you don't think he

1367
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,640
would be really impressed no of course

1368
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:37,200
everybody would be impressed but uh you

1369
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,079
know uh it's not a question of being

1370
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:41,079
impressed or not it's a question of

1371
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:42,599
knowing what the limit of those systems

1372
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:44,760
can do like there again they are

1373
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,799
impressive they can do a lot of useful

1374
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,400
things there's a whole industry that is

1375
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,039
being built around them they're going to

1376
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:52,920
make progress uh but there is a lot of

1377
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,079
things they cannot do and we have to

1378
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,680
realize what they cannot do do and uh

1379
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,400
and then figure out you know how we get

1380
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,079
there and you know and and I'm not

1381
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:04,039
seeing this I'm seeing this from

1382
00:56:04,039 --> 00:56:06,680
basically you know 10 years of of

1383
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:11,240
research uh on on the IDE of sell

1384
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,799
supervis learning actually that's going

1385
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:14,240
back more than 10 years but the IDE of

1386
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,839
cell supervis learning so basically

1387
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:18,640
capturing the internal structure of a

1388
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,200
piece of uh of of a set of inputs

1389
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,640
without training the system for any

1390
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,920
particular task right learning

1391
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,680
representations

1392
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,599
um you know the the conference I

1393
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,839
co-founded 14 years ago is called inter

1394
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:31,039
International Conference on learning

1395
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:33,280
representations that's the entire issue

1396
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,079
that deep learning is is dealing with

1397
00:56:35,079 --> 00:56:37,240
right and it's been my obsession for you

1398
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,880
know almost 40 years now so um so

1399
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,319
learning representation is really the

1400
00:56:41,319 --> 00:56:43,640
thing uh for the longest time we could

1401
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,599
only do this with supervised learning

1402
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,880
and then we started working on uh you

1403
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,680
know what we used to call unsupervised

1404
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:53,400
learning uh and sort of revive the idea

1405
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,920
of unsupervised learning uh in the early

1406
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,160
2000s with yosha benju and Jeff Hinton

1407
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,680
then discovered that supervisor leing

1408
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,400
actually works pretty well if you can

1409
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,200
collect enough data and so the whole

1410
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:07,599
idea of you know unsupervised supervisor

1411
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,839
kind I took a a backseat for for a bit

1412
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:15,079
and then I kind of tried to revive it um

1413
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:17,880
uh in a big way you know starting in

1414
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:21,319
2014 basically when we started fair and

1415
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:23,720
uh and really pushing for like finding

1416
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:25,760
new new methods to do cell supervised

1417
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,960
learning both for text and for images

1418
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,440
and for video and audio and some of that

1419
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,000
work has been incredibly successful um I

1420
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,480
mean the reason why we have multilingual

1421
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,280
translation system you know things to do

1422
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,079
content moderation on on meta for

1423
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,920
example on Facebook that are

1424
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,599
multilingual that understand whether

1425
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,480
piece of text is H speech or not or

1426
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,720
something is due to their progress using

1427
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:50,480
cell supervis learning for NLP combining

1428
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,680
this with you know Transformer

1429
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,839
architectures and and blah blah blah but

1430
00:57:53,839 --> 00:57:55,720
that's the big success of supervis rning

1431
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,920
we had similar success in speech

1432
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,119
recognition a system called wave to V

1433
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:01,240
which is also a joint embedding

1434
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,880
architecture by the way train with

1435
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:05,079
contrastive learning and and that that

1436
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:08,200
system also can produce um speech

1437
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,480
recognition systems that are

1438
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,960
multilingual with mostly unlabeled data

1439
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,720
and only need a few minutes of labeled

1440
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,960
data to actually do speech recognition

1441
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,240
that's that's amazing um we have systems

1442
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:22,200
now based on those combination of ideas

1443
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,760
that can do realtime translation of

1444
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,160
hundreds of languages into each other uh

1445
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,359
Speech to speech speech to speech even

1446
00:58:29,359 --> 00:58:31,760
including which is fascinating languages

1447
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,520
that uh don't have written forms that's

1448
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:35,960
right they spoken only that's right we

1449
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,520
don't go through text it goes directly

1450
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,079
from from speech to speech using an

1451
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:40,559
internal representation of kind of

1452
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,039
speech units that are discrete but it's

1453
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:44,920
um it's called text lesson LP we used to

1454
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,599
call it this way but um yeah so that I

1455
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,680
mean incredible success there and then

1456
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,839
you know for 10 years we tried to apply

1457
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:54,839
this idea to learning representations of

1458
00:58:54,839 --> 00:58:56,680
images by training a system to predict

1459
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,079
videos learning intuitive physics by

1460
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:00,440
training a system to predict what's

1461
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,559
going to happen in the video and tried

1462
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:05,799
and tried and failed and failed with

1463
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:07,319
generative models with models that

1464
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:08,559
predict

1465
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,200
pixels uh we could not get them to learn

1466
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,200
good well presentations of images we

1467
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,720
could not get them to learn good well

1468
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,760
presentations of videos and we tried

1469
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,119
many times we published lots of papers

1470
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:20,760
on it you know they kind of sort of work

1471
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,559
but not really great they started

1472
00:59:23,559 --> 00:59:27,079
working we we have been this idea of

1473
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:28,760
predicting every pixel and basically

1474
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,480
just doing the joint embedding and

1475
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:32,680
predicting in representation space that

1476
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,559
works MH so there's ample evidence that

1477
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,000
we're not going to be able to learn good

1478
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,880
we representations of the real world

1479
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,640
using generative model so I'm telling

1480
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,280
people everybody is talking about

1481
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,200
generative AI if you're really

1482
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,240
interested in human level AI abandon the

1483
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,559
idea of generate

1484
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,440
AI okay but you you you really think

1485
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,280
it's possible to get far with the joint

1486
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:58,880
embedding representation so like there's

1487
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:03,240
Common Sense reasoning and then there's

1488
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,480
highlevel reasoning like I I feel like

1489
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,480
those are

1490
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,920
two the kind of reasoning that LMS are

1491
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,079
able to do okay let me not use the word

1492
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:14,880
reasoning but the kind of stuff that LMS

1493
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,960
are able to do seems fundamentally

1494
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,599
different than the common sense

1495
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:20,640
reasoning we use to navigate the world

1496
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,920
yeah it seems like we're going to need

1497
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:24,960
both you're not would you be able to get

1498
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,240
with the joint embedding would is the

1499
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,039
JEA type of approach looking at video

1500
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:31,240
would you be able to

1501
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:34,039
learn let's see well how to get from New

1502
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:37,160
York to Paris or

1503
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,200
um how to uh understate understand the

1504
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,839
state of politics in the world today

1505
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:45,240
right these these are things where

1506
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,520
various humans generate a lot of

1507
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,599
language and opinions on in the space of

1508
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,559
language but don't visually represent

1509
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:56,119
that and you clearly uh compressible way

1510
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:58,039
right well there's a lot of situations

1511
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:00,960
that you know might be difficult to for

1512
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,400
a purely language based system to um to

1513
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,200
know like okay you can probably learn

1514
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,400
from Reading text the entirety of the

1515
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,480
Public Public avilable text in the world

1516
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,559
that I cannot get from New York to Paris

1517
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:15,680
by snapping my fingers that's not going

1518
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:18,760
to work right yes uh but there's you

1519
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,920
know probably sort of more complex uh

1520
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,640
scenarios of this type which an nlm May

1521
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,720
never have encountered and may not be

1522
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,400
able to determine whether it's possible

1523
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,039
or not um so um so that that link you

1524
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:34,640
know from the the low level to the high

1525
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,280
level the the thing is that the high

1526
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:40,000
level that language expresses is based

1527
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,200
on the common experience of the low

1528
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,520
level which llms currently do not have

1529
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,559
you know we when we talk to each other

1530
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:49,720
we know we have a common experience of

1531
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:52,000
the of the world like you know a lot of

1532
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,119
it is is similar

1533
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:56,640
uh

1534
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,599
and LMS don't have that but see there

1535
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:01,920
it's present you and I have a common

1536
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,279
experience of the world in terms of the

1537
01:02:03,279 --> 01:02:06,119
physics of how gravity works and stuff

1538
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:08,039
like this and

1539
01:02:08,039 --> 01:02:11,760
that common knowledge of the world I

1540
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,559
feel like is there in the language we

1541
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:18,000
don't explicitly express it but if you

1542
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,680
have a huge amount of text you're going

1543
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,480
to get this stuff that's between the

1544
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,599
lines you're going to you're going in

1545
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,680
order to um form a consistent world mod

1546
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,559
you're going to have to understand how

1547
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,599
gravity works even if you don't have an

1548
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:36,079
explicit explanation of gravity so even

1549
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:37,640
though in the case of gravity there is

1550
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,160
explicit explanations of gravity and

1551
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:43,760
wiia but uh you're like the stuff that

1552
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,480
we think of as common sense reasoning I

1553
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,200
feel like to generate language correctly

1554
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,760
you're going to have to figure that out

1555
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,559
now you could say as you have there's

1556
01:02:53,559 --> 01:02:57,200
not enough text okay so what you don't

1557
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:58,880
think so no I agree with what you just

1558
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,799
said which is that to be able to do high

1559
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:04,039
LEL um uh common sense to have high

1560
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:05,880
level common sense you need to have the

1561
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:07,480
low level common sense to build on top

1562
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:10,319
of yeah um but that's not there and

1563
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,359
that's not there in llms llms are purely

1564
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:14,039
trained from Tex so so then the other

1565
01:03:14,039 --> 01:03:16,119
statement you made um I would not I

1566
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:18,359
would not agree with the fact that

1567
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:20,440
implicit in all languages in the world

1568
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,240
is the underlying reality there's a lot

1569
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,200
about underlying reality which is not

1570
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,599
expressed in language is that obvious to

1571
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,279
you yeah

1572
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,319
totally so like

1573
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:34,440
all all the conversations we have what

1574
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,000
okay there's the Dark web meaning uh

1575
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,079
whatever the private conversations like

1576
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:41,839
DMS and stuff like this which is much

1577
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:44,160
much larger probably than what's

1578
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,880
available what what llms are trained on

1579
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,319
you don't need to communicate the stuff

1580
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:51,279
that is coming but the humor all of it

1581
01:03:51,279 --> 01:03:53,079
no you do like when you you don't need

1582
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,480
to but it comes through through like you

1583
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,599
like if I accidentally uh knock this

1584
01:03:57,599 --> 01:03:59,760
over you'll probably make fun of me and

1585
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,920
in the content of the you making fun of

1586
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,359
me will be a explanation of the fact

1587
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:08,559
that cups fall and then you know gravity

1588
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,680
Works in this way and then you you'll

1589
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:13,599
have some very vague information about

1590
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,559
what kind of things explode when they

1591
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:17,359
hit the ground and then maybe you'll

1592
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:19,359
make a joke about entropy or something

1593
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:20,520
like this and you will'll never be able

1594
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,799
to reconstruct this again like okay you

1595
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:25,079
make a a little joke like this and

1596
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:27,319
there'll be trillion of other jokes and

1597
01:04:27,319 --> 01:04:29,079
from the jokes you can piece together

1598
01:04:29,079 --> 01:04:31,480
the fact that gravity works and mugs can

1599
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,839
break and all this kind of stuff you

1600
01:04:32,839 --> 01:04:33,880
don't need to

1601
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:36,960
see uh it'll be very inefficient it's

1602
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,039
easier for like to not knock the thing

1603
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,119
over yeah but uh I feel like it would be

1604
01:04:44,119 --> 01:04:46,880
there if you have enough of that data I

1605
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,039
just think that most of the information

1606
01:04:50,039 --> 01:04:52,920
of this type that we have accumulated

1607
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,039
when when we were babies is just not

1608
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,480
present in uh in in text any in any

1609
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,480
description essentially and the sensory

1610
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:03,279
data is much is a much richer source for

1611
01:05:03,279 --> 01:05:04,440
getting that kind of understanding I

1612
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:07,319
mean that's the 16,000 hours of of wake

1613
01:05:07,319 --> 01:05:10,559
time of a four-year-old and uh 10 to the

1614
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,440
15 bytes you know going through vision

1615
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,680
just Vision right there is a

1616
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,640
similar uh bandwidth you know of touch

1617
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,559
and uh a little less through audio and

1618
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,200
then text doesn't language doesn't come

1619
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:26,079
in until like you know year uh in in

1620
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,520
life and by the time you are 9 years old

1621
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,079
you've learned about gravity you know

1622
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:32,720
about inertia you know about gravity you

1623
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,279
know the stability you know you know

1624
01:05:35,279 --> 01:05:36,920
about the distinction between animate

1625
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,319
and inanimate objects you know by 18

1626
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:42,279
months you know about like uh why people

1627
01:05:42,279 --> 01:05:44,520
want to do things and you help them if

1628
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,920
they can't you know I mean there's a lot

1629
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,640
of things that you learn mostly by

1630
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,720
observation really uh not even through

1631
01:05:51,720 --> 01:05:53,119
interaction in the first few months of

1632
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:55,000
life babies don't don't really have any

1633
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,359
influence on the world they can only

1634
01:05:56,359 --> 01:05:59,160
observe right and you accumulate like a

1635
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:02,359
gigantic amount of uh of knowledge just

1636
01:06:02,359 --> 01:06:03,680
just from that so that that's what we're

1637
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,440
missing from uh current AI

1638
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,599
systems I think in one of your slides

1639
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:11,319
you have this nice plot that is one of

1640
01:06:11,319 --> 01:06:13,880
the ways you show that llms are limited

1641
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:15,279
I wonder if you could talk about

1642
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:17,319
hallucinations from your

1643
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:20,640
perspectives the why hallucinations

1644
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,680
happen from large language models and

1645
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,599
why

1646
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,440
and to what degree is that a fundamental

1647
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:30,319
flaw of large language models right so

1648
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:33,119
because of the auto regressive

1649
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,039
prediction every time an LM produces a

1650
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:39,480
token or word uh there is some level of

1651
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:41,240
probability for that word to take you

1652
01:06:41,240 --> 01:06:44,400
out of the set of reasonable

1653
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,920
answers uh and if you assume which is a

1654
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,960
very strong assumption that the

1655
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:50,920
probability of such

1656
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:54,559
error um is that those errors are

1657
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,839
independent across a a sequence of

1658
01:06:57,839 --> 01:07:00,000
tokens being produced M what that means

1659
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,359
is that every time you produce a token

1660
01:07:02,359 --> 01:07:04,119
the probability that you rest you you

1661
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:05,920
stay within the the set of correct

1662
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,599
answer decreases and it decreases

1663
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:09,480
exponentially so there's a strong like

1664
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,720
you said assumption there that if uh

1665
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,240
there's a non-zero probability of making

1666
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:16,559
a mistake which there appears to be then

1667
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,760
there's going to be a kind of drift yeah

1668
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,720
and that drift is exponential it's like

1669
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:24,520
errors accumulate right so so the

1670
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:27,000
probability that an answer would be

1671
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,880
nonsensical increases exponentially with

1672
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,079
the number of tokens is that obvious to

1673
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,400
you by the way like well so

1674
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,279
mathematically speaking maybe but like

1675
01:07:37,279 --> 01:07:40,200
isn't there a kind of gravitational pull

1676
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,359
towards the truth because on on average

1677
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,960
hopefully the truth is well represented

1678
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,240
in the uh training set no it's basically

1679
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,599
a struggle against uh the curse of

1680
01:07:54,599 --> 01:07:56,200
dimensionality so the way you can

1681
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,000
correct for this is that you fine-tune

1682
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,720
the

1683
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,640
system by having it produce answers for

1684
01:08:01,640 --> 01:08:03,279
all kinds of questions that people might

1685
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:07,039
come up with M and people are people so

1686
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,359
they a lot of the questions that they

1687
01:08:08,359 --> 01:08:10,359
have are very similar to each other so

1688
01:08:10,359 --> 01:08:12,720
you can probably cover you know 80% or

1689
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:15,440
whatever of questions that people will

1690
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:20,040
will ask um by you know collecting data

1691
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:22,839
and then um and then you fine tune the

1692
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:24,839
system to produce good answers for all

1693
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:27,120
of those things and it's probably going

1694
01:08:27,120 --> 01:08:28,640
to be able to learn that because it's

1695
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:32,000
got a lot of capacity to to learn um but

1696
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,319
then there is you know the enormous set

1697
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,520
of prompts that you have not covered

1698
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:41,000
during training and that set is enormous

1699
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,600
like within the set of all possible

1700
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,560
prompts the proportion of prompts that

1701
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,279
have

1702
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:48,839
been uh used for training is absolutely

1703
01:08:48,839 --> 01:08:51,520
tiny um it's a it's a tiny tiny tiny

1704
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,198
subset of all possible prompts and so

1705
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:56,279
the system will behave properly on the

1706
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:57,920
prompts that it's been either trained

1707
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,679
pre-trained or

1708
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,520
fine-tuned um but then there is an

1709
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,719
entire space of things that it cannot

1710
01:09:05,719 --> 01:09:07,040
possibly have been trained on because

1711
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,238
it's just the the number is gigantic so

1712
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:13,238
um so whatever training the

1713
01:09:13,238 --> 01:09:16,920
system uh has been subject to to produce

1714
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,359
appropriate tensors you can break it by

1715
01:09:19,359 --> 01:09:21,439
finding out a prompt that will be

1716
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:24,560
outside of the the the set of promps has

1717
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,279
been trained on or things that are

1718
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:29,198
similar and then it will just P complete

1719
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:31,399
nonsense do you when you say prompt do

1720
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:33,719
you mean that exact prompt or do you

1721
01:09:33,719 --> 01:09:37,158
mean a prompt that's like in many parts

1722
01:09:37,158 --> 01:09:40,920
very different than like is that easy to

1723
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,600
ask a question or to say a thing that

1724
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,279
hasn't been said before on the internet

1725
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:48,000
I mean people have come up with uh

1726
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,719
things where like you you put a

1727
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,359
essentially a random sequence of

1728
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:54,080
characters in The Prompt and that's

1729
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,000
enough to kind of throw the system uh

1730
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,920
into a mode where you know it it's going

1731
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,360
to answer something completely different

1732
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:03,280
than it would have answered without this

1733
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,920
so that's a way to jailbreak the system

1734
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:06,840
basically get it you know go outside of

1735
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:09,520
its uh of its conditioning right so that

1736
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,239
that's a very clear demonstration of it

1737
01:10:11,239 --> 01:10:12,920
but of

1738
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:16,360
course uh you know that's uh that goes

1739
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:19,159
outside of what is designed to do right

1740
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:20,800
if you actually stitch together

1741
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:23,360
reasonably grammatical sentences is that

1742
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,800
the is it that easy to break it yeah

1743
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,320
some people have done things like you

1744
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,000
you you write a sentence in English

1745
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,199
right that has and or you ask a question

1746
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:35,080
in English and it it produces a

1747
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:37,239
perfectly fine answer and then you just

1748
01:10:37,239 --> 01:10:38,800
substitute a few

1749
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,600
words by the same word in another

1750
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,400
language and all of a sudden the answer

1751
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,120
is complete nonsense yeah so so I guess

1752
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,640
what I'm saying is like which fraction

1753
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,480
of prompts that humans are likely to

1754
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,360
generate are going to break the system

1755
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:56,400
so the the problem is that there is a

1756
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,360
long tail yes uh this is a an issue that

1757
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,760
a lot of people have realize you know in

1758
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,080
social networks and stuff like that

1759
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:05,800
which is uh there's a very very long

1760
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,199
taale of of things that people will ask

1761
01:11:08,199 --> 01:11:10,960
and you can find tune the system for the

1762
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,239
80% or whatever of uh of the things that

1763
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:16,440
most people will will ask and then this

1764
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:19,080
long tail is is so large that you're not

1765
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:20,800
going to be able to fun the system for

1766
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,880
all the conditions and in the end the

1767
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,360
system has a being kind of a giant

1768
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,920
lookup table right essentially which is

1769
01:11:26,920 --> 01:11:27,960
not really what you want you want

1770
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,040
systems that can reason certainly they

1771
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,239
can plan so the type of reasoning that

1772
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,400
takes place in llm is very very

1773
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,520
primitive and the reason you can tell is

1774
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:38,760
primitive is because the amount of

1775
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,520
computation that is spent per token

1776
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,199
produced is constant so if you ask a

1777
01:11:45,199 --> 01:11:47,880
question and that question has an answer

1778
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:50,600
in a given number of token the amount of

1779
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,199
competition devoted to Computing that

1780
01:11:52,199 --> 01:11:54,159
answer can be exactly

1781
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:57,120
estimated it's like you know it's it's

1782
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,719
the the size of the prediction Network

1783
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:02,080
you know with its 36 layers on 92 layers

1784
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,639
or whatever it is uh multiply by number

1785
01:12:04,639 --> 01:12:08,239
of tokens that's it and so essentially

1786
01:12:08,239 --> 01:12:10,440
it doesn't matter if the question being

1787
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:15,320
asked is is simple to answer complicated

1788
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,960
to answer impossible to answer because

1789
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,199
it's undecidable or something um the

1790
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:22,760
amount of computation the system will be

1791
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,639
able to devote to to the answer is

1792
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:27,040
constant or is proportional to number of

1793
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,639
token produced in the answer right this

1794
01:12:29,639 --> 01:12:32,840
is not the way we work the way we reason

1795
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:36,400
is that when we're faced with a complex

1796
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:38,840
problem or a complex question we spend

1797
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,239
more time trying to solve it and answer

1798
01:12:41,239 --> 01:12:43,760
it right because it's more difficult

1799
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,120
there's a prediction element there's a

1800
01:12:46,120 --> 01:12:49,520
iterative element where you're like

1801
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,080
uh adjusting your understanding of a

1802
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,040
thing by going over over and over and

1803
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,159
over there's a hierarchical element so

1804
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,080
on does this mean that a fundamental

1805
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:00,639
flaw of llms or does it mean

1806
01:13:00,639 --> 01:13:03,600
that there more part to that

1807
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:05,639
question now you're just behaving like

1808
01:13:05,639 --> 01:13:06,480
an

1809
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:11,360
llm immediately answer no that that it's

1810
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:14,679
just the lowlevel world model on top of

1811
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:17,679
which we can then build some of these

1812
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:19,520
kinds of mechanisms like you said

1813
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:21,920
persistent long-term memory

1814
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,040
or uh reasoning so on but we need that

1815
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:28,520
world model that comes from language is

1816
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,400
it maybe it is not so difficult to build

1817
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:34,320
this kind of uh reasoning system on top

1818
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:37,280
of a well constructed World model OKAY

1819
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,520
whether it's difficult or not the near

1820
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,719
future will will say because a lot of

1821
01:13:41,719 --> 01:13:43,760
people are working on reasoning and

1822
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,239
planning abilities for for dialog

1823
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,080
systems um I mean if we're even if we

1824
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,679
restrict ourselves to

1825
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:53,840
language uh just having the ability to

1826
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,800
plan your answer before you

1827
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:58,159
answer uh in terms that are not

1828
01:13:58,159 --> 01:14:00,000
necessarily linked with the language

1829
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,239
you're going to use to produce the

1830
01:14:01,239 --> 01:14:03,639
answer right so this idea of this mental

1831
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:05,199
model that allows you to plan what

1832
01:14:05,199 --> 01:14:08,679
you're going to say before you say it

1833
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:11,960
um that is very important I think

1834
01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:13,760
there's going to be a lot of systems

1835
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,360
over the next few years that are going

1836
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:18,120
to have this capability but the

1837
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,880
blueprint of those systems would be

1838
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,080
extremely different from autoregressive

1839
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,560
LMS so so

1840
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,719
um it's the same difference as the

1841
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,400
difference between what psychology is

1842
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,920
called system one and system two in

1843
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,360
humans right so system one is the type

1844
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:36,320
of task that you can accomplish without

1845
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:38,080
like deliberately consciously think

1846
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:42,000
about how you do them you just do them

1847
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,600
you've done them enough that you can

1848
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,639
just do it subconsciously right without

1849
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:46,960
thinking about them if you're an

1850
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,120
experience driver you can drive without

1851
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,440
really thinking about it and you can

1852
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:52,679
talk to someone at the same time or

1853
01:14:52,679 --> 01:14:53,840
listen to the radio

1854
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,639
right um if you are a very experienced

1855
01:14:57,639 --> 01:14:59,760
chess player you can play against a

1856
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,400
non-experienced chess player without

1857
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,800
really thinking either you just

1858
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,120
recognize the pattern and you play MH

1859
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,520
right that's system one um so all the

1860
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,120
things that you do instinctively without

1861
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:12,719
really having to deliberately plan and

1862
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,080
think about it and then there is all

1863
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,920
tasks what you need to plan so if you

1864
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,520
are not to experienced uh chess player

1865
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,000
or you are experienced with you play

1866
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,840
against another experienced chess player

1867
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,560
you think about all kinds of options

1868
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,000
right you you think about it for a while

1869
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,239
right and you you you're much better if

1870
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:30,679
you have time to think about it than you

1871
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:33,800
are if you if you play Blitz uh with

1872
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:37,760
limited time so and um so this type of

1873
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,199
deliberate uh planning which uses your

1874
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:44,520
internal World model um that system to

1875
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,800
this is what LMS currently cannot do so

1876
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,920
how how do we get them to do this right

1877
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:51,080
how do we build a system that can do

1878
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:54,520
this kind of uh planning that or

1879
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,480
reasoning that devotes more resources to

1880
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,400
complex problems than to simple problems

1881
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,280
and it's not going to be Auto regressive

1882
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,400
prediction of tokens it's going to be

1883
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:08,320
more something akin to inference of

1884
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:12,760
Laten variables in um you know what used

1885
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,360
to be called problemistic models or

1886
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,600
graphical models and things of that type

1887
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,600
so basically the principle is like this

1888
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,280
you you know the prompt is like a

1889
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:27,400
observed uh variables M and what your

1890
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:30,480
what the model does is that it's

1891
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,800
basically a

1892
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,040
measure of it can measure to what extent

1893
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:38,480
an answer is a good answer for a prompt

1894
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:40,520
okay so think of it as some gigantic

1895
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:42,520
neural net but it's got only one output

1896
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,320
and that output is a scalar number which

1897
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:48,040
is let's say zero if the answer is a

1898
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:50,440
good answer for the question and a large

1899
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,080
number if the answer is not a good

1900
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:54,120
answer for the question imagine you had

1901
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:56,639
this model if you had such a model you

1902
01:16:56,639 --> 01:16:58,920
could use it to produce good answers the

1903
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:00,360
way you would do

1904
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:03,040
is you know produce the pumpt and then

1905
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,719
search through the space of possible

1906
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:07,800
answers for one that minimizes that

1907
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:11,080
number um that's called an energy based

1908
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:14,199
model but that energy based model would

1909
01:17:14,199 --> 01:17:17,520
need the the model constructed by the

1910
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,560
llm well so uh really what you need to

1911
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,639
do would be to not uh search over

1912
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:25,560
possible strings of text that minimize

1913
01:17:25,560 --> 01:17:28,880
that uh energy but what you would do it

1914
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:31,040
do this in abstract representation space

1915
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:33,440
so in in sort of the space of abstract

1916
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,440
thoughts you would elaborate a thought

1917
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,159
right using this process of minimizing

1918
01:17:40,159 --> 01:17:42,719
the output of your your model okay which

1919
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:45,800
is just a scalar um it's an optimization

1920
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:47,960
process right so now the the way the

1921
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:51,000
system produces its answer is through

1922
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,520
optimization um by you know minimizing

1923
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,320
an objective function basically right uh

1924
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,239
and this is we're talking about

1925
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,480
inference we're not talking about

1926
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,880
training right the system has been

1927
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,719
trained already so now we have an

1928
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:04,199
abstract representation of the thought

1929
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:05,679
of the answer representation of the

1930
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:08,560
answer we feed that to basically an auto

1931
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:11,159
regive decoder uh which can be very

1932
01:18:11,159 --> 01:18:13,600
simple that turns this into a text that

1933
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,360
expresses this thought okay so that that

1934
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,080
in my opinion is the blueprint of future

1935
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:22,360
dialog systems um they will think about

1936
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,800
their answer plan their answer by

1937
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,320
optimization before turning it into

1938
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:31,440
text uh and that is tur complete can you

1939
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,239
explain exactly what the optimization

1940
01:18:33,239 --> 01:18:35,760
problem there is like what's the

1941
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,600
objective function just link on it you

1942
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,280
you kind of briefly described it but

1943
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,840
over what space are you optimizing the

1944
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,800
space of

1945
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,480
representations those abstract

1946
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:48,840
representation abstract repr so you have

1947
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:51,120
an abstract representation inside the

1948
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:52,960
system you have a prompt The Prompt goes

1949
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,320
through an encoder produces a

1950
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,920
representation perhaps goes through a

1951
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,560
predictor that predicts a representation

1952
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:59,840
of the answer of the proper answer but

1953
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:03,679
that representation may not be a good

1954
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,120
answer because there might there might

1955
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,679
be some complicated reasoning you need

1956
01:19:06,679 --> 01:19:10,159
to do right so um so then you have

1957
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:12,679
another process that takes the

1958
01:19:12,679 --> 01:19:14,520
representation of the answers and

1959
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,600
modifies it so as to

1960
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:20,080
minimize uh a cost function that

1961
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,600
measures to what extent the answer is a

1962
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,639
good answer for the question now we we

1963
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:28,199
sort of ignore the the fact for I mean

1964
01:19:28,199 --> 01:19:30,360
the issue for a moment of how you train

1965
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:33,920
that system to measure whether an answer

1966
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,199
is a good answer for for a question but

1967
01:19:36,199 --> 01:19:38,880
suppos such a system could be created

1968
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:40,960
but what's the process this kind of

1969
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:43,600
search like process it's a optimization

1970
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,719
process you can do this if if the entire

1971
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:46,719
system is

1972
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:49,679
differentiable that scalar output is the

1973
01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,719
result of you know running through some

1974
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:54,560
neural net mhm uh running the answer the

1975
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,920
representation of the answer to some

1976
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,360
neural net then by gradient descent by

1977
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,560
back propag back propagating gradients

1978
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,480
you can figure out like how to modify

1979
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:04,040
the representation of the answer so has

1980
01:20:04,040 --> 01:20:05,719
to minimize that so that's still a

1981
01:20:05,719 --> 01:20:07,679
gradient based it's gradient based

1982
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,159
inference so now you have a

1983
01:20:09,159 --> 01:20:11,159
representation of the answer in abstract

1984
01:20:11,159 --> 01:20:13,719
space now you can turn it into

1985
01:20:13,719 --> 01:20:17,600
text right and the cool thing about this

1986
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,840
is that the representation now can be

1987
01:20:20,840 --> 01:20:23,280
optimized through gr and descent but so

1988
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:24,760
is independent of the language in which

1989
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,639
you're going to express the

1990
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:28,880
answer right so you're operating in the

1991
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,360
substract representation I mean this

1992
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,560
goes back to the Joint embedding right

1993
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,320
that is better to work in the uh in the

1994
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:38,760
space of I don't know to romanticize the

1995
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:41,360
notion like space of Concepts versus

1996
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,440
yeah the space of

1997
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:46,400
concrete sensory information

1998
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,440
right okay but this can can this do

1999
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,920
something like reasoning which is what

2000
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,920
we're talking about well not really in

2001
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,320
only in a very simple way I mean

2002
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,239
basically you can think of those things

2003
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,679
that's doing the kind of optimization I

2004
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:00,679
was I was talking about except the

2005
01:21:00,679 --> 01:21:02,480
optimize in a discrete space which is

2006
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,760
the space of possible sequences of of

2007
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:07,000
tokens and they do it they do this

2008
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
optimization in a horribly inefficient

2009
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,560
way which is generate a lot of

2010
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,320
hypothesis and then select the best ones

2011
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:14,679
and that's

2012
01:21:14,679 --> 01:21:17,840
incredibly wasteful in terms of uh

2013
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,600
computation because you have you run you

2014
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,639
basically have to run your LM for like

2015
01:21:21,639 --> 01:21:26,040
every you know Genera sequence um and

2016
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,480
it's incredibly wasteful um so it's much

2017
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,480
better to do an optimization in

2018
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,239
continuous space where you can do great

2019
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:35,920
and descent as opposed to like generate

2020
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,000
tons of things and then select the best

2021
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,960
you just iteratively refine your answer

2022
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:43,000
to to go towards the best right that's

2023
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,840
much more efficient you can only do this

2024
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,360
in continuous spaces with differentiable

2025
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,239
functions you're talking about the

2026
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:52,280
reasoning like ability to think deeply

2027
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,080
or to reason

2028
01:21:54,080 --> 01:21:56,960
deeply how do you know

2029
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,960
what is an

2030
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:03,120
answer uh that's better or worse based

2031
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:05,560
on deep reasoning right so then we're

2032
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:07,440
asking the question of conceptually how

2033
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,280
do you train an energy base model right

2034
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,000
so en based model is a function with a

2035
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,840
scalar output just a

2036
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:18,080
number you give it two inputs X and Y

2037
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,520
and it tells you whether Y is compatible

2038
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,920
with X or not X You observe let's say

2039
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,159
it's a pump image video whatever and why

2040
01:22:25,159 --> 01:22:28,120
is a proposal for an answer a

2041
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:31,360
continuation of video um you know

2042
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,360
whatever and it tells you whether Y is

2043
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,960
compatible with X and the way it tells

2044
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,840
you that Y is compatible with X is that

2045
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,199
the output of that function would be

2046
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:41,639
zero if Y is compatible with X it would

2047
01:22:41,639 --> 01:22:45,120
be a positive number non zero if Y is

2048
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,840
not compatible with X okay how do you

2049
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:50,320
train a system like this at a completely

2050
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:54,600
General level is you show it pairs of X

2051
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,800
and Y that are compatible a question and

2052
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,159
the corresponding answer and you train

2053
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:01,360
the parameters of the big neural net

2054
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:03,719
inside U to produce

2055
01:23:03,719 --> 01:23:06,920
zero okay now that doesn't completely

2056
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:08,840
work because the system might decide

2057
01:23:08,840 --> 01:23:10,520
well I'm just going to say zero for

2058
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,480
everything so now you have to have a

2059
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,480
process to make sure that for a a wrong

2060
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:18,760
y the energy would be larger than zero

2061
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,880
and there you have two options one is

2062
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,760
contrastive Method so contrastive method

2063
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,199
is you show an X and a bad

2064
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:28,000
Y and you tell the system well that's

2065
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,760
you know give a high energy to this like

2066
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:31,199
push up the energy right change the

2067
01:23:31,199 --> 01:23:32,600
weights in the neural net that comput

2068
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,199
the energy so that it goes

2069
01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:37,719
up um so that's contrasting methods the

2070
01:23:37,719 --> 01:23:40,360
problem with this is if the space of Y

2071
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:44,199
is large the number of such contrasty

2072
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:45,560
samples you're going to have to

2073
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:47,480
show is

2074
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,560
gigantic but people do this they they do

2075
01:23:50,560 --> 01:23:53,520
this when you train a system with RF

2076
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,600
basically what you're training is what's

2077
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,679
called a reward model which is basically

2078
01:23:58,679 --> 01:24:00,880
an objective function that tells you

2079
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,639
whether an answer is good or bad and

2080
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,880
that's basically exactly what what this

2081
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:08,400
is so we already do this to some extent

2082
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:09,800
we're just not using it for inference

2083
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:13,920
we're just using it for training um uh

2084
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,920
there is another set of methods which

2085
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:19,120
are non contrastive and I prefer those

2086
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,880
uh and those non-contrastive method

2087
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,960
basically say

2088
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:26,520
uh okay the energy function needs to

2089
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:29,520
have low energy on pairs of xys that are

2090
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:31,320
compatible that come from your training

2091
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:34,080
set how do you make sure that the energy

2092
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,120
is going to be higher everywhere

2093
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:40,040
else and the way you do this is by um

2094
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:43,719
having a regularizer a Criterion a term

2095
01:24:43,719 --> 01:24:45,880
in your cost function that basically

2096
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:49,400
minimizes the volume of space that can

2097
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:50,719
take low

2098
01:24:50,719 --> 01:24:53,199
energy and the precise way to do this is

2099
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,920
all kinds of different specific ways to

2100
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:56,360
do this depending on the architecture

2101
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:58,960
but that's the basic principle so that

2102
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:01,320
if you push down the energy function for

2103
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:04,040
particular regions in the XY space it

2104
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,159
will automatically go up in other places

2105
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:08,920
because there's only a limited volume of

2106
01:25:08,920 --> 01:25:12,080
space that can take low energy okay by

2107
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,800
the construction of the system or by the

2108
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:16,760
regularizer regularizing function we've

2109
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,360
been talking very generally but what is

2110
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,800
a good X and a good Y what is a good

2111
01:25:21,800 --> 01:25:22,880
representation

2112
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:26,360
of X and Y because we've been talking

2113
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:28,280
about language and if you just take

2114
01:25:28,280 --> 01:25:31,600
language directly that presumably is not

2115
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,199
good so there has to be some kind of

2116
01:25:33,199 --> 01:25:35,159
abstract representation of

2117
01:25:35,159 --> 01:25:37,679
ideas yeah so you I mean you can do this

2118
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:40,360
with language directly um by just you

2119
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,920
know X is a text and Y is a continuation

2120
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,679
of that text yes um or X is a question

2121
01:25:46,679 --> 01:25:48,520
why is the answer but you're you're

2122
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:49,679
saying that's not going to take it I

2123
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,280
mean that's going to do what llms are

2124
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,760
doing well no it depends on how you how

2125
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,679
the internal structure of the system is

2126
01:25:56,679 --> 01:25:58,480
built if the if the internal structure

2127
01:25:58,480 --> 01:25:59,960
of the system is built in such a way

2128
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,760
that inside of this system there is a

2129
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,119
latent variable it's called Z that

2130
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:10,320
uh you can manipulate so as to minimize

2131
01:26:10,320 --> 01:26:12,000
the output

2132
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,040
energy then that Z can be viewed as a

2133
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,880
representation of a good answer that you

2134
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,040
can translate into a y that is a good

2135
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,320
answer so this kind of system could be

2136
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:25,000
train in a very similar way very similar

2137
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,960
way but you have to have this way of

2138
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:29,800
preventing collapse of of ensuring that

2139
01:26:29,800 --> 01:26:31,920
you know there is high energy for things

2140
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,679
you don't train it on um and and

2141
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:38,639
currently it's it's very implicit in llm

2142
01:26:38,639 --> 01:26:39,760
is done in a way that people don't

2143
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,280
realize it's being done but is it is

2144
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:43,760
being done is is due to the fact that

2145
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:48,199
when you give a high probability to a a

2146
01:26:48,199 --> 01:26:50,239
word automatically you give low

2147
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:51,960
probability to other words because you

2148
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:54,840
only have a finite amount of probability

2149
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,639
to go around right there have to some to

2150
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:58,880
one so when you minimize the cross

2151
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,320
entropy or whatever when you train the

2152
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,679
your llm to produce the to predict the

2153
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:04,440
next

2154
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:07,080
word uh you're increasing the

2155
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:08,560
probability your system will give to the

2156
01:27:08,560 --> 01:27:10,000
correct word but you're also decreasing

2157
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,080
the probability will give to the

2158
01:27:11,080 --> 01:27:14,800
incorrect words now indirectly that

2159
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,239
gives a low probability to a high

2160
01:27:17,239 --> 01:27:18,840
probability to sequences of words that

2161
01:27:18,840 --> 01:27:20,440
are good and low probability to

2162
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,800
sequences of words that are bad but it's

2163
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:24,800
very direct mhm and it's not it's not

2164
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:26,760
obvious why this actually works at all

2165
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,719
but um because you're not doing it on a

2166
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:31,920
joint probability of all the symbols in

2167
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,679
a in a sequence you're just doing it

2168
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:36,960
kind of uh you sort of factorize that

2169
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,920
probability in terms of conditional

2170
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:41,440
probabilities over successive tokens so

2171
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,199
how do you do this for visual data so

2172
01:27:44,199 --> 01:27:45,440
we've been doing this with all jepa

2173
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:49,400
architectures basically the joint I so

2174
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,760
uh there are the compatibility between

2175
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,000
two things is uh you know here's here's

2176
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,880
an image or a video here's a corrupted

2177
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,520
shifted or transformed version of that

2178
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:02,360
image or video or masked okay and then

2179
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,199
uh the energy of the system is the

2180
01:28:05,199 --> 01:28:08,360
prediction error of

2181
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:11,080
the

2182
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:13,360
representation uh the the predicted

2183
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,000
representation of the Good Thing versus

2184
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:16,440
the actual representation of the good

2185
01:28:16,440 --> 01:28:19,960
thing right so so you run the corrupted

2186
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,440
image to the system predict the

2187
01:28:21,440 --> 01:28:23,760
representation of the the good input

2188
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,360
uncorrupted and then compute the

2189
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,159
prediction error that's the energy of

2190
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:30,040
the system so this system will tell you

2191
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:32,600
this is a

2192
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,080
good you know if this is a good image

2193
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:37,000
and this is a corrupted version it will

2194
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,119
give you Zero Energy if those two things

2195
01:28:39,119 --> 01:28:41,679
are effectively one of them is a

2196
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:43,480
corrupted version of the other give you

2197
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:45,440
a high energy if if the two images are

2198
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,239
completely different and hopefully that

2199
01:28:47,239 --> 01:28:49,960
whole process gives you a really nice

2200
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:53,440
compressed representation of of reality

2201
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,520
of visual reality and we know it does

2202
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,800
because then we use those for our

2203
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:58,320
presentations as input to a

2204
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,679
classification system something system

2205
01:29:00,679 --> 01:29:03,400
works really nicely okay well so to

2206
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:08,119
summarize you recommend in a in a in a

2207
01:29:08,119 --> 01:29:10,520
spicy way that only Yan laon can you

2208
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,199
recommend that we abandon generative

2209
01:29:12,199 --> 01:29:13,960
models in favor of joint embedding

2210
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:16,159
architectures yes abandon autor

2211
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:19,600
regressive generation yes abandon Pro

2212
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,000
this feels like a court testimony uh

2213
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,080
abandon probabilistic models in favor of

2214
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,159
energy based models as we talked about

2215
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:28,360
abandon contrastive methods in favor of

2216
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:31,119
regularized methods and uh let me ask

2217
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:34,600
you about this you've been for a while a

2218
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:37,480
Critic of reinforcement learning yes so

2219
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,560
what uh the last recommendation is that

2220
01:29:39,560 --> 01:29:42,600
we abandon RL in favor of Mo model

2221
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,280
predictive control as you were talking

2222
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:47,239
about and only use RL when planning

2223
01:29:47,239 --> 01:29:50,520
doesn't yield the pr predicted outcome

2224
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:53,199
and uh we use RL in that case to adjust

2225
01:29:53,199 --> 01:29:57,560
the world model or the critic yes so uh

2226
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:00,880
you mentioned uh rlf reinforcement

2227
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,400
learning with human feedback uh why do

2228
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:05,719
you still hate uh reinforcement learning

2229
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:07,080
I don't hate reinforcement learning and

2230
01:30:07,080 --> 01:30:10,400
I think all of I think it should not be

2231
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,960
uh abandoned completely but I think its

2232
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,119
use should be minimized because it's

2233
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:17,360
incredibly inefficient in terms of

2234
01:30:17,360 --> 01:30:19,840
samples and so the the proper way to

2235
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,360
train a system is to First just have it

2236
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,280
learn uh good representations of the

2237
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,719
world and World models from Mostly

2238
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:30,440
observation maybe a little bit of

2239
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,800
interactions and then steered based on

2240
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,320
that if the representation is good then

2241
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,000
the adjustment should be

2242
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,119
minimal yeah now there's two things you

2243
01:30:38,119 --> 01:30:39,920
can use if you've learned a world model

2244
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,800
you can use the world model to plan a

2245
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,280
sequence of actions to arrive at a

2246
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,800
particular

2247
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:48,920
objective you don't need a unless the

2248
01:30:48,920 --> 01:30:50,280
way you measure whether you succeed

2249
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:54,560
might be inexact your idea of you know

2250
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:57,360
whether you're going to fall from your

2251
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,639
bike might be wrong or whether the

2252
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:02,360
person you're fighting with MMA is going

2253
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:05,480
to do something and do something else um

2254
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:09,040
so there uh so there's two ways you can

2255
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,800
be wrong either your your objective

2256
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,040
function does not reflect the actual

2257
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,360
objective function you want to optimize

2258
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,560
or your world model is

2259
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:21,080
inaccurate right so you didn't you the

2260
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,480
prediction you were making about what

2261
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:24,360
was going to happen in the world is

2262
01:31:24,360 --> 01:31:26,719
inaccurate so if you want to adjust your

2263
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:29,920
world model while you are operating the

2264
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:34,159
world or your objective function that is

2265
01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:36,119
basically in the realm of RL this is

2266
01:31:36,119 --> 01:31:39,040
what RL deal deals with uh to some

2267
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,000
extent right so adjust your world model

2268
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:43,000
and the way to adjust your world model

2269
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:46,840
even in advance uh is to explore parts

2270
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,199
of the space where your world model

2271
01:31:48,199 --> 01:31:49,679
where you know that your world model is

2272
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:52,080
inaccurate that's called curiosity

2273
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:55,679
basically or play right when you play

2274
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,760
you kind of explore part of the St space

2275
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,320
that

2276
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:04,199
um you know you don't want to do in for

2277
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:06,400
real because it might be dangerous but

2278
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,760
but you can adjust your world model uh

2279
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,199
without killing yourself basically um so

2280
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:15,199
that's what you want to use ourl for

2281
01:32:15,199 --> 01:32:16,920
when when when it comes time to learning

2282
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:19,520
a particular task you already have all

2283
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:20,920
the good representations you already

2284
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,400
have your world model but you want you

2285
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,159
need to adjust it for the situation at

2286
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:26,920
hand that's when you use RL why do you

2287
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:30,400
think rhf works so well this

2288
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:31,679
reinforcement learning with human

2289
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:33,760
feedback why did it have such a

2290
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:36,080
transformational effect on large

2291
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:38,400
language models that before what's had

2292
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,119
the transformational effect is human

2293
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:43,639
feedback there's many ways to use it and

2294
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:45,440
some of it is just purely supervised

2295
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,800
actually it's not really reinforcement

2296
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,239
rning so it's the the HF it's the HF

2297
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,400
yeah uh and then there is ways to use

2298
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,400
human feedback right so you can you can

2299
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,600
ask humans to rate answers multiple

2300
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,840
answers that are produced by World model

2301
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:04,119
and uh and and then what you do is you

2302
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:06,440
train an objective function to predict

2303
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:07,199
that

2304
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:09,600
rating and then you can use that

2305
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:12,600
objective function to predict you know

2306
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:13,880
whether an answer is good and you can

2307
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,080
back propagate gradient through this to

2308
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:16,840
find you new system so that it only

2309
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:19,800
produces High highly rated

2310
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,119
answers okay so that's

2311
01:33:22,119 --> 01:33:25,440
one way so that's like in ourl that

2312
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:28,000
means uh training what's called a reward

2313
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,679
model right so something that you know

2314
01:33:30,679 --> 01:33:32,320
basically a small on that that estimates

2315
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:35,040
to what extent an answer is good right

2316
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:37,040
it's very similar to The Objective I was

2317
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,719
I was talking about talking about

2318
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:40,360
earlier for planning except now it's not

2319
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:41,840
used for planning it's it's used for

2320
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,360
fine-tuning your

2321
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:45,119
system I think it would be much more

2322
01:33:45,119 --> 01:33:48,400
efficient to use it for planning but um

2323
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,719
but but uh currently it's used to fine

2324
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:52,880
tune the parameters the system now there

2325
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:54,960
there's several ways to do this um you

2326
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,440
know some of some of them are supervised

2327
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:59,679
you just you know ask a human person

2328
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:02,040
like what is a good answer for this

2329
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:05,760
right then you just type the answer um

2330
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,040
uh I mean there's there's lots of ways

2331
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:09,679
that those systems are are being

2332
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:12,600
adjusted now a lot of people have been

2333
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:15,560
very critical of the recently released

2334
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,920
Google's Gemini

2335
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,280
1.5 for essentially in my words I could

2336
01:34:21,280 --> 01:34:24,520
say super woke woke in the negative

2337
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:26,840
connotation of that word uh there is

2338
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:29,679
some almost hilariously absurd things

2339
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:32,719
that it does like it modifies history uh

2340
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:36,239
like generating images of a u black

2341
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:40,280
George Washington or um perhaps more

2342
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,000
seriously something that you commented

2343
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,440
on Twitter which is refusing to comment

2344
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:50,040
on or generate images of U or even

2345
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:54,159
descriptions of tianan square or the the

2346
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:56,320
Tank Man one of the most sort of

2347
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:58,600
legendary protest

2348
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:02,159
images in history and of course these

2349
01:35:02,159 --> 01:35:05,480
images are highly censored by the

2350
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:08,239
Chinese government and therefore

2351
01:35:08,239 --> 01:35:10,040
everybody start asking questions of what

2352
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,280
is the process of

2353
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:15,639
uh designing these llms what is what is

2354
01:35:15,639 --> 01:35:17,520
what is the role of censorship in these

2355
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,400
all that kind of stuff so you uh

2356
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,080
commented on Twitter saying that open

2357
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:26,840
source is the answer yeah essentially so

2358
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:28,639
um can you

2359
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:31,119
explain I I actually made that comment

2360
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:32,960
on just about every Social Network I can

2361
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:36,440
and I've I I've uh I've made that point

2362
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:40,560
multiple times in in various forums um

2363
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,119
uh here's my my point of view on this uh

2364
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:46,520
people can complain that AI systems are

2365
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:50,119
biased and they generally are biased by

2366
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:52,080
the distribution of the training data

2367
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,480
that they've been trained on um that

2368
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,560
reflects biases in

2369
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:02,560
society um and that is potentially

2370
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,880
offensive to some

2371
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:08,480
people or potentially not and and some

2372
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,639
techniques to

2373
01:36:09,639 --> 01:36:13,199
debias then become offensive to some

2374
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:18,679
people um because of you know historical

2375
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:22,159
uh incorrectness and things like that

2376
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:25,440
um and so you can ask the question you

2377
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,840
can ask two questions the first question

2378
01:36:26,840 --> 01:36:29,520
is is it possible to produce an AI

2379
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,360
system that is not biased and the answer

2380
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,840
is absolutely not and it's not because

2381
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,040
of

2382
01:36:35,040 --> 01:36:37,800
technological uh challenges although

2383
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:40,440
there are technological challenges to

2384
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:42,639
that it's

2385
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:45,520
because bias is in the eye of the

2386
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:47,639
beholder um different people may have

2387
01:36:47,639 --> 01:36:50,000
different ideas about what constitutes

2388
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
bias um you know for a lot of uh a lot

2389
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,320
of things I mean there are facts that

2390
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:57,679
are you know indisputable but there are

2391
01:36:57,679 --> 01:36:59,840
a lot of opinions or or things that can

2392
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,199
be expressed in different ways U and so

2393
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:04,880
you cannot have an unbiased system

2394
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,679
that's just an

2395
01:37:06,679 --> 01:37:10,280
impossibility um and so what's

2396
01:37:10,280 --> 01:37:12,920
the what's the answer to this and the

2397
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,520
the answer is the same answer that we

2398
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,800
found in Liberal democracy about the

2399
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:24,280
press the Press to be free and uh

2400
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:27,080
diverse we have free speech for a good

2401
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:30,920
reason is because uh we don't want all

2402
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,679
of our information to be uh to come from

2403
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:37,560
a unique Source um because that's

2404
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,400
opposite to the whole idea of democracy

2405
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:43,599
and uh you know progress of ideas and

2406
01:37:43,599 --> 01:37:45,920
even science right in in science people

2407
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,000
have to argue for different opinions and

2408
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,800
and science makes progress when people

2409
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,480
disagree and they come up with an answer

2410
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,639
and you know a consensus forms right and

2411
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:57,000
it's true in all democracies around the

2412
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,840
world so there is a

2413
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:03,760
future which is already happening where

2414
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:06,239
every single one of our interaction with

2415
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:09,239
the digital world will be mediated by ai

2416
01:38:09,239 --> 01:38:13,000
ai systems AI assistants right we're

2417
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:14,920
going to have smart glasses you can

2418
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:18,199
already buy them from MAA the ran MAA

2419
01:38:18,199 --> 01:38:20,560
where um you know you can talk to them

2420
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,440
and they are connected with an llm and

2421
01:38:22,440 --> 01:38:24,800
you can get answers on any question you

2422
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:28,679
have or you can be looking at a monument

2423
01:38:28,679 --> 01:38:30,639
and there is a camera in the in the

2424
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:32,599
system that in in the glasses you can

2425
01:38:32,599 --> 01:38:34,040
ask it like can what can you tell me

2426
01:38:34,040 --> 01:38:36,320
about this uh building or this Monument

2427
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:38,400
you can be looking at a menu in a

2428
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:39,719
foreign language and I thing will

2429
01:38:39,719 --> 01:38:41,880
translate it for you or we can do real

2430
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,199
time translation if we speak different

2431
01:38:44,199 --> 01:38:47,280
languages so a lot of our interactions

2432
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:48,560
with the digital world are going to be

2433
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:50,280
mediated by those systems in the near

2434
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:51,920
future

2435
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:55,560
um you know increasingly the search

2436
01:38:55,560 --> 01:38:57,040
engines that we're going to use are not

2437
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,199
going to be search engines they're going

2438
01:38:58,199 --> 01:39:02,679
to be uh dialog systems that would just

2439
01:39:02,679 --> 01:39:05,159
ask a question and it will answer and

2440
01:39:05,159 --> 01:39:07,960
then point you to perhaps appropriate

2441
01:39:07,960 --> 01:39:10,440
reference for it but here is the thing

2442
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:12,239
we cannot afford those systems to come

2443
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,239
from a handful of companies on the west

2444
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:16,239
coast of the

2445
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:19,159
US because those systems will constitute

2446
01:39:19,159 --> 01:39:22,679
the repository of all human knowledge

2447
01:39:22,679 --> 01:39:25,760
and we cannot have that be controlled by

2448
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:28,239
a small number of people right it has to

2449
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:30,040
be diverse for the same reason the Press

2450
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:31,159
has to be

2451
01:39:31,159 --> 01:39:34,239
diverse so how do we get a diverse set

2452
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:35,560
of AI

2453
01:39:35,560 --> 01:39:38,480
assistant um it's very expensive and

2454
01:39:38,480 --> 01:39:40,560
difficult to train a based model right a

2455
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:42,560
based llm at the moment you know in the

2456
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,920
future it might be something different

2457
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:46,040
but at the moment that's an

2458
01:39:46,040 --> 01:39:48,599
llm uh so only a few companies can do

2459
01:39:48,599 --> 01:39:49,599
this

2460
01:39:49,599 --> 01:39:52,320
properly and

2461
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,000
if some of those Tob systems are open

2462
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,599
source anybody can use them anybody can

2463
01:39:57,599 --> 01:40:00,840
fine-tune them um if we put in place

2464
01:40:00,840 --> 01:40:05,320
some systems that allows any group of

2465
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:09,440
people whether they are um individual

2466
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,239
citizens groups of

2467
01:40:11,239 --> 01:40:14,440
citizens government organizations

2468
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:19,400
NOS uh companies whatever to take those

2469
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,719
open source

2470
01:40:21,719 --> 01:40:24,520
uh systems AI systems and fine-tune them

2471
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:26,520
for their own purpose on their own

2472
01:40:26,520 --> 01:40:28,520
data then we're going to have a very

2473
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:31,599
large diversity of uh different AI

2474
01:40:31,599 --> 01:40:33,080
systems that are specialized for all of

2475
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:36,440
those things right so I tell you I

2476
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:37,800
talked to the French government quite a

2477
01:40:37,800 --> 01:40:40,360
bit and the French government will not

2478
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:43,360
accept that the digital diet of all

2479
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,800
their citizen be controlled by three

2480
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:47,960
companies on the west coast of the US

2481
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:50,000
that's just not acceptable it's a danger

2482
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,040
to democracy regardless of how

2483
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:54,199
well-intentioned those companies are

2484
01:40:54,199 --> 01:40:58,199
right um and so uh and it's also a

2485
01:40:58,199 --> 01:41:03,719
danger to local culture to values to

2486
01:41:03,719 --> 01:41:07,119
language right I was talking with

2487
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:12,040
um uh the uh founder of infosis in India

2488
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:15,679
um he's funding a project to fine tune

2489
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:18,480
Lama 2 the open source model produced by

2490
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:21,679
by meta so that Lama 2 speak all 22

2491
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:24,360
official languages in India it's very

2492
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:26,560
important for people in India I was

2493
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,119
talking to a former colleague of mine

2494
01:41:28,119 --> 01:41:31,159
Mustafa used to be a scientist at fair

2495
01:41:31,159 --> 01:41:32,840
and then moved back to Africa I created

2496
01:41:32,840 --> 01:41:35,239
a research lab for Google in Africa and

2497
01:41:35,239 --> 01:41:38,599
now is as a new startup Kara and what

2498
01:41:38,599 --> 01:41:40,440
he's trying to do is basically have llm

2499
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,760
that speak the local languages in Sagal

2500
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:45,000
so that people can have access to

2501
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,560
medical information because they don't

2502
01:41:46,560 --> 01:41:47,960
have access to doctors it's a very small

2503
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:51,040
number of doctors per per capita in the

2504
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:55,199
in syal um I mean you can't have any of

2505
01:41:55,199 --> 01:41:56,880
this unless you have open source

2506
01:41:56,880 --> 01:41:59,119
platforms so with open source platforms

2507
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:01,000
you can have ai systems that are not

2508
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,800
only diverse in terms of political

2509
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,320
opinions or things of that type but in

2510
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:10,840
terms of uh uh language culture value

2511
01:42:10,840 --> 01:42:14,400
systems political opinions

2512
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:17,840
um technical abilities in various

2513
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:20,280
domains and you can have an industry an

2514
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:23,000
ecosystem of companies that fine-tune

2515
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,440
those open source systems for vertical

2516
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,360
applications in Industry right you you

2517
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:29,400
have I don't know a publisher has

2518
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,159
thousands of books and they want to

2519
01:42:31,159 --> 01:42:33,040
build a system that allows a customer to

2520
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:35,520
just just ask a question about any about

2521
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,599
the content of any of their books you

2522
01:42:37,599 --> 01:42:39,679
need to train on their proprietary data

2523
01:42:39,679 --> 01:42:42,719
right um You have a company we have one

2524
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:45,000
within meta it's called metam and it's

2525
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,199
basically an llm that can answer any

2526
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:50,480
question about internal uh stuff about

2527
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:53,320
about the the company U very useful a

2528
01:42:53,320 --> 01:42:55,280
lot of companies want this right a lot

2529
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,080
of companies want this not just for

2530
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:58,400
their employees but also for their

2531
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:00,760
customers to take care of the customers

2532
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:02,840
so the only way you're going to have an

2533
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:05,040
AI industry the only way you're going to

2534
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,599
have ai systems that are not uniquely

2535
01:43:07,599 --> 01:43:09,760
biased is if you have open source

2536
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,199
platforms on top of which uh any group

2537
01:43:13,199 --> 01:43:17,239
Can U build specialized systems

2538
01:43:17,239 --> 01:43:21,639
so the the direction of of inevitable

2539
01:43:21,639 --> 01:43:24,320
direction of history is that the vast

2540
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,679
majority of AI systems will be built on

2541
01:43:26,679 --> 01:43:28,840
top of Open Source platforms so that's a

2542
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:32,119
beautiful Vision so meaning

2543
01:43:32,119 --> 01:43:36,800
like a company like meta or Google or so

2544
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,800
on should take only minimal fine-tuning

2545
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:42,960
steps after the building the foundation

2546
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:46,239
pre-trained model as few steps as

2547
01:43:46,239 --> 01:43:48,560
possible

2548
01:43:48,560 --> 01:43:51,800
basically can meta afford to do that no

2549
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:53,840
so I don't know if you you know this but

2550
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,360
companies are supposed to make money

2551
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:59,320
somehow and uh open source is is is like

2552
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:01,760
giving away I don't know Mark made a

2553
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:03,679
video Mark

2554
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:06,560
Zuckerberg um very sexy video talking

2555
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,960
about

2556
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,239
350,000 Nvidia

2557
01:44:11,239 --> 01:44:14,880
h100s yeah the the math of that is just

2558
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:17,599
for the gpus that's 100

2559
01:44:17,599 --> 01:44:20,880
billion um plus the infrastructure for

2560
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:25,000
training everything so I'm no business

2561
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,800
guy but how do you make money on that so

2562
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:29,119
the division you payt is a really

2563
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:31,800
powerful one but how is it possible to

2564
01:44:31,800 --> 01:44:34,840
make money okay so you have several

2565
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:37,440
business models right the business model

2566
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,679
that uh MAA is built

2567
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:41,239
around

2568
01:44:41,239 --> 01:44:44,199
is um youer a

2569
01:44:44,199 --> 01:44:47,760
service and the the financing of that

2570
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:51,000
service is uh either through ads or

2571
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,920
through business customers so for

2572
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:55,920
example if you have an llm that uh you

2573
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:59,639
know can help a mom and pop pizza place

2574
01:44:59,639 --> 01:45:01,719
um by you know talking to their

2575
01:45:01,719 --> 01:45:03,920
customers through WhatsApp and so the

2576
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:06,800
customers can just order a pizza and the

2577
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:08,599
system will just you know ask them like

2578
01:45:08,599 --> 01:45:10,080
what topping do you want or what sites

2579
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:13,159
blah blah blah um the business will pay

2580
01:45:13,159 --> 01:45:15,280
for that okay that's a

2581
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:18,280
model

2582
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:21,280
um and otherwise you know if it's a

2583
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:23,360
system that is on the more kind of

2584
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,719
classical Services it can be uh ad

2585
01:45:25,719 --> 01:45:27,599
supported or you know there's several

2586
01:45:27,599 --> 01:45:29,280
models but the point

2587
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:33,199
is uh if you have a big enough um

2588
01:45:33,199 --> 01:45:35,159
potential customer base and you need to

2589
01:45:35,159 --> 01:45:36,360
build that

2590
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:39,000
system anyway for

2591
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,480
them it doesn't hurt you to actually

2592
01:45:41,480 --> 01:45:43,599
distribute it in open source again I'm

2593
01:45:43,599 --> 01:45:46,639
no business guy but if you release the

2594
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:49,119
open source model then other people can

2595
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:51,159
do the same kind of

2596
01:45:51,159 --> 01:45:54,560
task and compete on it basically provide

2597
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:57,760
fine-tune models for businesses the is

2598
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,960
the bet that meta is making by the way

2599
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:02,159
I'm a huge fan of all this but is is the

2600
01:46:02,159 --> 01:46:04,080
bet that meta is making is like we'll do

2601
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:07,239
a better job of it well no the the bet

2602
01:46:07,239 --> 01:46:10,280
is is more we have we already have a

2603
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:13,400
huge user base and customer base ah

2604
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,639
right right so it's going to be useful

2605
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:16,840
to them whatever we offer them is going

2606
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,280
to be useful and there is a way to

2607
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,480
derive revenue from this

2608
01:46:21,480 --> 01:46:25,440
uh and it doesn't hurt that you know we

2609
01:46:25,440 --> 01:46:26,800
provide that

2610
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:29,320
system or the Bas the base model right

2611
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:32,560
the foundation model uh in open source

2612
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,679
for others to build applications on top

2613
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:36,800
of it too if those applications are not

2614
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,440
to be useful for our customers we can

2615
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:42,719
just buy it from them um uh it could be

2616
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:44,320
that they will improve the platform in

2617
01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:46,639
fact we see this already um I mean there

2618
01:46:46,639 --> 01:46:48,320
is you know literally millions of

2619
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:51,320
downloads of Lama 2 and thousands of

2620
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:53,599
people who have you know provided ideas

2621
01:46:53,599 --> 01:46:56,400
about how to make it better um so you

2622
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,760
know this this clearly accelerates

2623
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:01,400
progress to make the system available to

2624
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:05,480
a sort of a a wide community of people

2625
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,239
and and there is literally thousands of

2626
01:47:07,239 --> 01:47:08,880
businesses who are building applications

2627
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,520
with it so um

2628
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:16,639
so our ability to meta's ability to

2629
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,520
derive revenue from this technology is

2630
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:21,560
not impaired

2631
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:24,920
uh by the distribution of it of based

2632
01:47:24,920 --> 01:47:27,000
models in open source the fundamental

2633
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,360
criticism that Gemini is getting is that

2634
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,320
as you point out on the west coast just

2635
01:47:31,320 --> 01:47:33,719
to just to clarify we're currently in

2636
01:47:33,719 --> 01:47:36,159
the east coast where I would suppose

2637
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:38,400
meta AI headquarters would

2638
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,920
be so there uh strong words about the

2639
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,960
West Coast but uh I guess the issue that

2640
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:48,080
happens is I think it's fair to say that

2641
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:51,360
most tech people have

2642
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,040
a political affiliation with the left

2643
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:56,280
wing they're they lean left and so the

2644
01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:57,719
problem that people are criticizing

2645
01:47:57,719 --> 01:48:00,000
Gemini with is that there's in that

2646
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:02,800
debiasing process that you mentioned

2647
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,239
that their

2648
01:48:04,239 --> 01:48:06,480
ideological

2649
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:08,760
lean becomes

2650
01:48:08,760 --> 01:48:11,920
obvious uh is this something that could

2651
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,920
be

2652
01:48:13,920 --> 01:48:16,239
escaped you're saying open source is the

2653
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:18,239
only way have have you witnessed this

2654
01:48:18,239 --> 01:48:20,800
kind of ideological lean that makes

2655
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,320
engineering difficult no I don't think

2656
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:25,119
it has to do I don't think the issue has

2657
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:27,000
to do with the political leaning of the

2658
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,719
people designing those systems it has to

2659
01:48:29,719 --> 01:48:33,760
do with the uh acceptability or

2660
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:36,880
political leanings of the their customer

2661
01:48:36,880 --> 01:48:39,840
based audience right so a big company

2662
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,599
cannot afford to offend too many people

2663
01:48:43,599 --> 01:48:46,599
so they're going to make sure that

2664
01:48:46,599 --> 01:48:49,320
whatever product they put out is safe

2665
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:52,119
whatever that means

2666
01:48:52,119 --> 01:48:56,080
and and it's very possible to overdo it

2667
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,280
and it's also very possible to it's

2668
01:48:58,280 --> 01:48:59,800
impossible to do it properly for

2669
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,440
everyone you're not going to satisfy

2670
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:03,679
everyone so that's what I said before

2671
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:05,000
you cannot have a system that is

2672
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,560
unbiased is perceived as unbiased by

2673
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:10,400
everyone it's going to be you know you

2674
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,920
push it in one way one set of people are

2675
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:14,920
going to see it as biased and then you

2676
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:16,320
push it the other way and another set of

2677
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:18,599
people is going to see it that's biased

2678
01:49:18,599 --> 01:49:20,199
and then in addition to this there's the

2679
01:49:20,199 --> 01:49:22,880
issue of if you push the system perhaps

2680
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,320
a little too far in One Direction it's

2681
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:25,920
going to be non-factual right you're

2682
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:28,880
going to have you know you know black

2683
01:49:28,880 --> 01:49:32,119
Nazi uh soldiers in the we should we

2684
01:49:32,119 --> 01:49:35,440
should mention image generation of of uh

2685
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:37,520
black Nazi soldiers which is not

2686
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:40,000
factually accurate right and can be

2687
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,320
offensive for some people as well right

2688
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:43,880
so

2689
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:46,159
uh so you know it's going to be

2690
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:47,800
impossible to kind of produce systems

2691
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:49,880
that are unbiased for everyone so the

2692
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:53,000
only solution that I see is diversity

2693
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,560
and diversity in the full meaning of

2694
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:56,960
that word diversity of in every possible

2695
01:49:56,960 --> 01:50:03,000
way yeah uh Mark Andre just tweeted

2696
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:07,000
today let me do a tldr the conclusion is

2697
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,880
only startups and open source can avoid

2698
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,400
the issue that he's highlighting with

2699
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:14,520
big Tech he's asking can big Tech

2700
01:50:14,520 --> 01:50:17,480
actually field generative AI products

2701
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:19,400
one ever escalating demands from

2702
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,840
internal Act activists employee mobs

2703
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,719
crazed Executives broken boards pressure

2704
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:26,679
groups extremist Regulators government

2705
01:50:26,679 --> 01:50:30,560
agencies the press in quotes experts and

2706
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:34,880
everything uh corrupting the output two

2707
01:50:34,880 --> 01:50:37,280
constant risk of generating a bad answer

2708
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:39,560
or drawing a bad picture or rendering a

2709
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:43,040
bad video who knows what is going to say

2710
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:46,560
or do at any moment three legal exposure

2711
01:50:46,560 --> 01:50:48,800
product liability slander election law

2712
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:52,320
many other things and so on anything

2713
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:53,920
that makes Congress

2714
01:50:53,920 --> 01:50:56,920
mad four continuous attempts to tighten

2715
01:50:56,920 --> 01:50:58,760
grip un acceptable output degrade the

2716
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:02,560
model like how good it actually is uh in

2717
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,960
terms of usable and pleasant to use and

2718
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:07,159
effective and all that kind of stuff and

2719
01:51:07,159 --> 01:51:10,440
five publicity of bad text images video

2720
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:12,320
actually puts those examples into the

2721
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:15,719
training data for the next version so on

2722
01:51:15,719 --> 01:51:17,760
so he just highlights how difficult this

2723
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,400
is from all kinds of people being

2724
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,679
unhappy as you said you can't create a

2725
01:51:22,679 --> 01:51:25,520
system that makes everybody happy yes uh

2726
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,119
so if you're going to do the fine tun

2727
01:51:28,119 --> 01:51:30,920
yourself and keep a close

2728
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:33,239
Source essentially the problem there is

2729
01:51:33,239 --> 01:51:34,800
then trying to minimize the number of

2730
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:38,040
people who are going to be unhappy y um

2731
01:51:38,040 --> 01:51:40,199
and you're saying like the only that

2732
01:51:40,199 --> 01:51:42,480
that almost impossible to do right and

2733
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:45,639
it's the better ways to do open source

2734
01:51:45,639 --> 01:51:48,639
phasically yeah I mean he's Mark is

2735
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:50,880
right about uh a number number of things

2736
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:55,599
that you list that indeed scare um large

2737
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:57,920
companies uh you know certainly

2738
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,880
Congressional investigations is one of

2739
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:04,320
them legal liability uh you know uh

2740
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:06,840
making things that get people to you

2741
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,239
know hurt themselves or hurt others like

2742
01:52:09,239 --> 01:52:12,159
you know um big companies are really

2743
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:14,599
careful about not um producing things of

2744
01:52:14,599 --> 01:52:17,000
this type and

2745
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:20,079
um because they have you know they want

2746
01:52:20,079 --> 01:52:21,560
to hurt anyone first of all and then

2747
01:52:21,560 --> 01:52:22,800
second they want to preserve their

2748
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:25,239
business so um it's essentially

2749
01:52:25,239 --> 01:52:27,000
impossible for systems like this that

2750
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,280
can inevitably formulate political

2751
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,199
opinions and you know opinions about

2752
01:52:32,199 --> 01:52:33,760
various things that may be political or

2753
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:36,159
not but that people may disagree about

2754
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:40,440
about you know moral issues and you know

2755
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:42,960
um things about like questions about

2756
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:44,599
religion and things like that right or

2757
01:52:44,599 --> 01:52:47,199
or cultural issues that people from

2758
01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:48,440
different communities would disagree

2759
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:50,400
with in the first place um so there's

2760
01:52:50,400 --> 01:52:52,079
only kind of a relatively small number

2761
01:52:52,079 --> 01:52:53,440
of things that people

2762
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:57,239
will uh sort of agree on you know basic

2763
01:52:57,239 --> 01:52:59,440
principles but beyond that if you if you

2764
01:52:59,440 --> 01:53:01,920
want those systems to be useful they

2765
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:05,119
will necessarily have to uh

2766
01:53:05,119 --> 01:53:08,079
offend a number of people

2767
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:10,480
inevitably and so open source is just

2768
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,679
better and then diversity is better

2769
01:53:12,679 --> 01:53:15,480
right and open source enables diversity

2770
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:16,800
that's right open source enables

2771
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,239
diversity that this can be fascinating

2772
01:53:19,239 --> 01:53:20,800
world where

2773
01:53:20,800 --> 01:53:22,840
if it's true that the open source world

2774
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:24,920
if meta leads the way and creates this

2775
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:26,679
kind of Open Source Foundation model

2776
01:53:26,679 --> 01:53:28,760
world there's going to be like

2777
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:31,639
governments will have a find new model

2778
01:53:31,639 --> 01:53:34,639
and yeah and and then

2779
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:38,400
potentially uh you know people that vote

2780
01:53:38,400 --> 01:53:39,960
left and right will have their own model

2781
01:53:39,960 --> 01:53:42,079
and preference and be able to choose and

2782
01:53:42,079 --> 01:53:44,520
it will potentially divide us even more

2783
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:47,639
but that's on us humans we get to figure

2784
01:53:47,639 --> 01:53:50,159
out basically the technology enables

2785
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:54,440
humans to human more effectively and all

2786
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:56,440
the difficult ethical questions that

2787
01:53:56,440 --> 01:54:00,480
humans raise will just it'll um leave it

2788
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:03,239
up to us to figure it out yeah I mean

2789
01:54:03,239 --> 01:54:04,719
there are some limits to what you know

2790
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:06,079
the same way there are limits to free

2791
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:08,280
speech there has to be some limit to the

2792
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:10,480
kind of stuff that those systems might

2793
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:11,760
be authorized

2794
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:15,840
to um to produce um you know some guard

2795
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:17,480
rails so I mean that's one thing I've

2796
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:20,040
been interested in which is uh in the

2797
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:21,320
type of architecture that we were

2798
01:54:21,320 --> 01:54:25,040
discussing before where the output of a

2799
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,920
system is the result of an inference to

2800
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:30,679
satisfy an objective that objective can

2801
01:54:30,679 --> 01:54:32,000
include guard

2802
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,079
rails and uh we can put guard rails in

2803
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:38,040
open source systems I mean if we

2804
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:39,679
eventually have systems that are built

2805
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:42,360
with this blueprint uh we can put guard

2806
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:44,760
rails uh in those systems that guarantee

2807
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:47,800
that there is sort of a minimum set of

2808
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,360
guardrails that make the system non-

2809
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:51,440
dangerous and nontoxic Etc you know

2810
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,360
basic things that everybody would agree

2811
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:56,920
on um and and then you know the the fine

2812
01:54:56,920 --> 01:54:58,639
tuning that people will add or the

2813
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:00,119
additional guardwell that people will

2814
01:55:00,119 --> 01:55:03,079
add will kind of cater to their um

2815
01:55:03,079 --> 01:55:06,040
Community whatever it is and yeah the

2816
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:07,599
fine doing will be more about the gray

2817
01:55:07,599 --> 01:55:09,880
areas of what is hate speech what is

2818
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:11,480
dangerous and all that kind of stuff I

2819
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:13,639
mean you've different value systems

2820
01:55:13,639 --> 01:55:15,800
value systems I mean like uh but still

2821
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:17,480
even with the objectives of how to build

2822
01:55:17,480 --> 01:55:19,040
a bioweapon for example I think

2823
01:55:19,040 --> 01:55:20,960
something you've commented on or at

2824
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,320
least there's a

2825
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:24,560
paper where a collection of researchers

2826
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:26,920
is trying to understand the social

2827
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,520
impacts of these

2828
01:55:28,520 --> 01:55:31,840
llms and I guess one threshold is nice

2829
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:35,119
is like does the llm make it any easier

2830
01:55:35,119 --> 01:55:38,480
than a than a search would like a Google

2831
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:42,599
search would right so the increasing uh

2832
01:55:42,599 --> 01:55:46,560
number of studies on this seems to point

2833
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:50,119
to the fact that it doesn't help so

2834
01:55:50,119 --> 01:55:54,400
having an llm doesn't help you design or

2835
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:57,159
build a bioweapon or a chemical weapon

2836
01:55:57,159 --> 01:55:59,199
if you already have access to uh you

2837
01:55:59,199 --> 01:56:02,400
know a search engine and a library uh

2838
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:03,960
and and so the the S of increased

2839
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:05,400
information you get or the ease with

2840
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:07,560
which you get it doesn't really help you

2841
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:09,239
um that's the first thing the second

2842
01:56:09,239 --> 01:56:11,880
thing is it's one thing to have a list

2843
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:14,800
of instructions of how to make a

2844
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:16,960
chemical weapon for example or bioweapon

2845
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:19,800
it's another thing to actually build it

2846
01:56:19,800 --> 01:56:21,719
and it's much harder than you might

2847
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:23,800
think and then LM will not help you with

2848
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:26,679
that um in fact you know nobody in the

2849
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:28,320
world not even like you know countries

2850
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:31,400
use bioweapons because most of the time

2851
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:32,840
they have no idea how to protect their

2852
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:35,880
own populations against it so um so it's

2853
01:56:35,880 --> 01:56:37,920
too dangerous actually to kind of ever

2854
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:42,239
use um and it's in fact banned by uh

2855
01:56:42,239 --> 01:56:44,520
International treaties um chemical

2856
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:46,239
weapons is different it's also banned by

2857
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:50,239
treaties U but um uh but it's the same

2858
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:52,360
problem it's difficult to use in

2859
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:55,480
situations that doesn't turn against the

2860
01:56:55,480 --> 01:56:57,520
perpetrators but we could ask you on

2861
01:56:57,520 --> 01:57:00,440
musk like I can I can give you a very

2862
01:57:00,440 --> 01:57:02,000
precise list of instructions of how you

2863
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,040
build a rocket engine M and even if you

2864
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:07,079
have a team of 50 Engineers that of re

2865
01:57:07,079 --> 01:57:08,639
experienc building it you're still going

2866
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:10,079
to have to blow up a dozen of them

2867
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:11,480
before you get when that

2868
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:15,040
works um and you know it's the same with

2869
01:57:15,040 --> 01:57:18,480
uh you know chemical weapons or biow

2870
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:20,480
weapons or things like this it requires

2871
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:22,679
expertise you know in the in the real

2872
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:24,760
world that n is not going to help you

2873
01:57:24,760 --> 01:57:27,199
with and it requires even the common

2874
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:28,760
sense expertise that we've been talking

2875
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:32,480
about which is how to take uh

2876
01:57:32,480 --> 01:57:34,119
language-based instructions and

2877
01:57:34,119 --> 01:57:36,840
materialize them in the physical world

2878
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:39,840
requires a lot of knowledge that's not

2879
01:57:39,840 --> 01:57:42,480
in the instructions yeah exactly a lot

2880
01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:44,079
of biologists have posted on this

2881
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:45,639
actually in response to those things

2882
01:57:45,639 --> 01:57:47,280
saying like do you realize how hard it

2883
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:49,480
is to actually do the the lab work I you

2884
01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:51,119
know this is not

2885
01:57:51,119 --> 01:57:54,920
trivial yeah and that's Hans Marik comes

2886
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:57,440
comes to light once again uh just the

2887
01:57:57,440 --> 01:57:59,920
Linger on llama you know Mark announced

2888
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:01,800
that llama 3 is coming out eventually I

2889
01:58:01,800 --> 01:58:04,400
don't think there's a release date but

2890
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:06,800
what what are you most excited about

2891
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,480
first of all llama 2 that's already out

2892
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:11,800
there and maybe the future llama 3 4 5 6

2893
01:58:11,800 --> 01:58:14,320
10 just the the future of the open

2894
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,199
source under

2895
01:58:16,199 --> 01:58:18,880
meta well a number of things so uh

2896
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,239
there's going to be like various

2897
01:58:20,239 --> 01:58:24,119
versions of of Lama that are uh you know

2898
01:58:24,119 --> 01:58:27,360
improvements of previous llamas bigger

2899
01:58:27,360 --> 01:58:30,760
better multimodal things like that and

2900
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:32,480
then in future Generations systems that

2901
01:58:32,480 --> 01:58:34,639
are capable of planning that really

2902
01:58:34,639 --> 01:58:36,960
understand how the world Works um maybe

2903
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:38,400
are trained from video so they have some

2904
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:41,199
World model maybe you know capable of

2905
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:42,719
the type of reasoning and planning I was

2906
01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:44,639
talking about earlier like how long is

2907
01:58:44,639 --> 01:58:46,520
that going to take like when is the

2908
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:47,960
research that is doing going in that

2909
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:50,840
direction going to sort of feed into the

2910
01:58:50,840 --> 01:58:53,800
product line if you want of L I don't

2911
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,400
know I can't tell you and there's you

2912
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:57,400
know a few breakthroughs that we have to

2913
01:58:57,400 --> 01:59:00,960
basically uh go through before we can

2914
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:03,679
get there but you'll be able to monitor

2915
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:06,360
our progress because we publish our

2916
01:59:06,360 --> 01:59:09,560
research right so you know if last week

2917
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:12,440
we published the Via work which is sort

2918
01:59:12,440 --> 01:59:14,239
of a first step towards Training Systems

2919
01:59:14,239 --> 01:59:17,040
from video um and then the next step is

2920
01:59:17,040 --> 01:59:20,159
going to be World models based on on

2921
01:59:20,159 --> 01:59:22,040
kind of this type of idea training

2922
01:59:22,040 --> 01:59:24,480
training from video there similar work

2923
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,760
at at Deep Mind also and um the taking

2924
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:31,719
place people and also at UC brookley on

2925
01:59:31,719 --> 01:59:34,000
uh World models from video a lot of

2926
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,520
people are working on this I think a lot

2927
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:38,480
of good ideas are coming are appearing

2928
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:40,880
my bet is that those systems are going

2929
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,560
to be Jep alike they're not going to be

2930
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:46,760
gener generative models um and uh we'll

2931
01:59:46,760 --> 01:59:50,719
see what the future will tell um there's

2932
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:54,679
really good work at uh um a gentleman

2933
01:59:54,679 --> 01:59:56,560
called danar Hafner who is not Deep Mind

2934
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:58,360
who who's worked on kind of models of

2935
01:59:58,360 --> 02:00:00,119
this type that learn representations and

2936
02:00:00,119 --> 02:00:02,679
then use them for planning or learning

2937
02:00:02,679 --> 02:00:06,360
tasks by reinforcement running um and a

2938
02:00:06,360 --> 02:00:10,000
lot of work at brookley by Peter iil S

2939
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:12,760
leine bunch of other people of that type

2940
02:00:12,760 --> 02:00:14,800
uh I'm collaborating with actually in

2941
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:17,920
the context of some grants with my NYU

2942
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,880
hat um

2943
02:00:19,880 --> 02:00:21,520
and then collaborations also through

2944
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:25,000
meta because the the lab at brookley is

2945
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,679
associated with meta in some way so with

2946
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:30,320
fair so I I think uh it's very exciting

2947
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:33,079
you know I I think I'm super excited

2948
02:00:33,079 --> 02:00:35,599
about I I haven't been that excited

2949
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:36,920
about like the direction of machine

2950
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:40,520
learning and AI you know since uh you

2951
02:00:40,520 --> 02:00:42,159
know 10 years ago when Fairway started

2952
02:00:42,159 --> 02:00:45,159
and before that um 30 years ago when we

2953
02:00:45,159 --> 02:00:50,320
working on 35 on on com Nets and and and

2954
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:53,719
the early days of neural net so um I'm

2955
02:00:53,719 --> 02:00:56,480
super excited because I see a path

2956
02:00:56,480 --> 02:00:59,079
towards potentially human level

2957
02:00:59,079 --> 02:01:01,280
intelligence uh with you know systems

2958
02:01:01,280 --> 02:01:04,679
that can understand the world remember

2959
02:01:04,679 --> 02:01:08,520
plan reason um there there is some some

2960
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:10,560
set of ideas to make progress there that

2961
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,520
might have a chance of working and I'm

2962
02:01:12,520 --> 02:01:15,280
really excited about this what I like is

2963
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:17,639
that you know it

2964
02:01:17,639 --> 02:01:20,800
uh somewhere we we get onto like a good

2965
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:22,960
direction and perhaps succeed before my

2966
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:25,800
brain turns to white sauce or or before

2967
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,560
I need to

2968
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:31,119
retire yeah yeah uh you're also excited

2969
02:01:31,119 --> 02:01:33,239
by are

2970
02:01:33,239 --> 02:01:35,920
you is it beautiful to you just the

2971
02:01:35,920 --> 02:01:39,480
amount of gpus involved sort of the the

2972
02:01:39,480 --> 02:01:41,800
the whole training process on this much

2973
02:01:41,800 --> 02:01:44,400
compute it's just zooming out just

2974
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:46,960
looking at Earth and humans together

2975
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:49,679
have built these Computing devices

2976
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:52,599
and are able to train this one

2977
02:01:52,599 --> 02:01:56,639
brain then then we then open

2978
02:01:56,639 --> 02:01:59,400
source like giving birth to this

2979
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:02,119
open-source brain trained on this

2980
02:02:02,119 --> 02:02:04,840
gigantic compute system there's just the

2981
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:07,920
details of how to train on that how to

2982
02:02:07,920 --> 02:02:09,560
build the infrastructure and the the

2983
02:02:09,560 --> 02:02:11,320
hardware the cooling all of this kind of

2984
02:02:11,320 --> 02:02:13,679
stuff U or you just still the most of

2985
02:02:13,679 --> 02:02:15,599
your excitement is in the the theory

2986
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:18,119
aspect of it the meaning like the

2987
02:02:18,119 --> 02:02:19,639
software

2988
02:02:19,639 --> 02:02:20,960
well I used to be a hardware guy many

2989
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:23,119
years ago yes yes that's decades ago

2990
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:25,639
Hardware has improved a little bit

2991
02:02:25,639 --> 02:02:28,000
changed a little bit yeah I mean

2992
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,360
certainly scale is necessary but not

2993
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:33,800
sufficient absolutely so we certainly

2994
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,480
need competition I mean we're still far

2995
02:02:35,480 --> 02:02:37,040
in terms of compute

2996
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:39,320
power uh from you know what we would

2997
02:02:39,320 --> 02:02:41,199
need to match the compute power of the

2998
02:02:41,199 --> 02:02:43,440
human brain um you know this may occur

2999
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:46,199
in the next couple decades but um but

3000
02:02:46,199 --> 02:02:48,040
we're still some ways away and certainly

3001
02:02:48,040 --> 02:02:50,719
in terms of power efficiency were really

3002
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:53,639
far um so a lot of progress to make in

3003
02:02:53,639 --> 02:02:57,639
uh in in in hardware and you know right

3004
02:02:57,639 --> 02:03:00,199
now a lot of progress is is is not I

3005
02:03:00,199 --> 02:03:02,360
mean there's a bit coming from Silicon

3006
02:03:02,360 --> 02:03:04,560
technology but a lot of it coming from

3007
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:06,920
architectural Innovation and quite a bit

3008
02:03:06,920 --> 02:03:10,119
coming from uh like more efficient ways

3009
02:03:10,119 --> 02:03:11,639
of you know implementing the

3010
02:03:11,639 --> 02:03:13,599
architectures that have become popular

3011
02:03:13,599 --> 02:03:16,400
basically combination of Transformers

3012
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:19,920
and cets right and uh so you know

3013
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:23,480
there's still some ways to go

3014
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:27,599
until uh we're going to saturate we're

3015
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:29,280
going to have to come up with like new

3016
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:30,920
new principles new fabrication

3017
02:03:30,920 --> 02:03:34,480
technology new uh basic

3018
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:37,360
components um perhaps you know based on

3019
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:39,400
sort of different principles than those

3020
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:42,520
classical digital semas interesting so

3021
02:03:42,520 --> 02:03:43,239
you

3022
02:03:43,239 --> 02:03:48,960
think in order to build Ami M me we need

3023
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,000
we potentially might need some Hardware

3024
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,559
Innovation too well if you want to make

3025
02:03:53,559 --> 02:03:56,679
it um ubiquitous yeah certainly because

3026
02:03:56,679 --> 02:03:59,199
we're going to have to reduce the you

3027
02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:02,679
know comput the power consumption a GPU

3028
02:04:02,679 --> 02:04:05,800
today right is half a kilowatt to a

3029
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:08,960
kilowatt human brain is about 25

3030
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:12,119
wats uh and the GPU is way below the

3031
02:04:12,119 --> 02:04:13,679
power of human brain you need you know

3032
02:04:13,679 --> 02:04:15,440
something like a 100,000 or million to

3033
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:18,920
match it so uh so you know we're off by

3034
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:20,480
huge Factor

3035
02:04:20,480 --> 02:04:23,320
here you often say that

3036
02:04:23,320 --> 02:04:27,119
AGI is not coming soon meaning like not

3037
02:04:27,119 --> 02:04:30,800
this year not the next few years

3038
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:33,599
potentially farther away what's your

3039
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:36,320
basic intuition behind that so first of

3040
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:39,000
all it's not going to be an event right

3041
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,960
the idea somehow which you know is

3042
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:42,639
popularized by science fiction and

3043
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:45,159
Hollywood that you know somehow somebody

3044
02:04:45,159 --> 02:04:47,239
is going to discover the secret the

3045
02:04:47,239 --> 02:04:50,760
secret to a gii or human level AI or Ami

3046
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:52,639
whatever you want to call it and then

3047
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:54,239
you know turn on a machine and then we

3048
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:56,520
have a gii that's just not going to

3049
02:04:56,520 --> 02:04:58,679
happen it's not going to be an

3050
02:04:58,679 --> 02:05:02,440
event it's going to be gradual

3051
02:05:02,440 --> 02:05:04,480
progress are we going to have systems

3052
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:07,360
that can learn from video how the world

3053
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:09,480
works and learn good World presentations

3054
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:12,360
yeah before we get them to the scale and

3055
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:13,880
performance that we observe in humans

3056
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:15,599
it's going to take quite a while it's

3057
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:19,520
not going to happen in one day um uh are

3058
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:22,280
we going to get systems that can uh have

3059
02:05:22,280 --> 02:05:24,639
large amount of associative memory so

3060
02:05:24,639 --> 02:05:26,880
they can they can remember stuff yeah

3061
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:28,159
but same it's not going to happen

3062
02:05:28,159 --> 02:05:30,000
tomorrow I mean there is some basic

3063
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:31,520
techniques that need to be developed we

3064
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,679
have a lot of them but like you know to

3065
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:35,639
get this to work together with full

3066
02:05:35,639 --> 02:05:37,320
system is another story how we going to

3067
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:39,199
have system that can reason and plan

3068
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:41,760
perhaps along the lines of the objective

3069
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,719
driven AI architectures that I I

3070
02:05:43,719 --> 02:05:45,880
described before yeah but like before we

3071
02:05:45,880 --> 02:05:47,520
get this to work you know properly it's

3072
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:49,239
going to take a while so

3073
02:05:49,239 --> 02:05:50,520
and before we get all those things to

3074
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:52,719
work together and then on top of this

3075
02:05:52,719 --> 02:05:54,119
have systems that can learn like

3076
02:05:54,119 --> 02:05:55,760
hierarchical planning hierarchical

3077
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:58,239
representations systems that can be

3078
02:05:58,239 --> 02:05:59,920
configured for a lot of different

3079
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:01,800
situation at hands the way the human

3080
02:06:01,800 --> 02:06:05,599
brain can um you know all of this is

3081
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:07,639
going to take you know at least a decade

3082
02:06:07,639 --> 02:06:10,159
and probably much more because there are

3083
02:06:10,159 --> 02:06:12,159
a lot of problems that we're not seeing

3084
02:06:12,159 --> 02:06:15,320
right now we have not encountered and so

3085
02:06:15,320 --> 02:06:16,639
we don't know if there is a easy

3086
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:19,440
solution within this framework

3087
02:06:19,440 --> 02:06:22,679
um so you know it's it's not just around

3088
02:06:22,679 --> 02:06:24,520
the corner I mean I've I've been hearing

3089
02:06:24,520 --> 02:06:28,000
people for the last 12 15 years claiming

3090
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:29,520
that you know edgi is just around the

3091
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:32,440
corner and being systematically wrong

3092
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:33,480
and I knew they were wrong when they

3093
02:06:33,480 --> 02:06:35,520
were saying it I call their

3094
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,520
 why do you think people have

3095
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:38,880
been calling first of all I mean from

3096
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:40,679
the beginning of from the birth of the

3097
02:06:40,679 --> 02:06:43,079
term artificial intelligence there has

3098
02:06:43,079 --> 02:06:45,239
been a Eternal

3099
02:06:45,239 --> 02:06:47,599
optimism that's perhaps unlike other

3100
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:52,760
Technologies is it a Maric Paradox is

3101
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:54,679
the explanation for why people are so

3102
02:06:54,679 --> 02:06:57,520
optimistic about AGI I don't think it's

3103
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:59,559
just Marx Paradox Marx Paradox is a

3104
02:06:59,559 --> 02:07:02,480
consequence of realizing that the world

3105
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:04,440
is not as easy as we think so first of

3106
02:07:04,440 --> 02:07:08,280
all um intelligence is not a linear

3107
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:10,400
thing that you can measure with a scalar

3108
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:13,840
with a single number um you know can you

3109
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:15,920
say that humans are smarter

3110
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:20,360
than WR tongs in some ways yes but in

3111
02:07:20,360 --> 02:07:22,119
some waysons are smarter than humans in

3112
02:07:22,119 --> 02:07:24,800
a lot of domains that allows them to

3113
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:27,320
survive in the forest for example so IQ

3114
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:29,599
is a very limited measure of

3115
02:07:29,599 --> 02:07:31,520
intelligence T intelligence is bigger

3116
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:33,960
than what IQ for example measures well

3117
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:37,199
IQ can measure you know approximately

3118
02:07:37,199 --> 02:07:41,719
something for humans MH but um because

3119
02:07:41,719 --> 02:07:44,719
humans kind of you know come in

3120
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:48,840
relatively kind of uniform form right

3121
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:52,119
right uh but it only measures one type

3122
02:07:52,119 --> 02:07:54,719
of uh ability that you know may be

3123
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:56,559
relevant for some test but not

3124
02:07:56,559 --> 02:07:58,119
others

3125
02:07:58,119 --> 02:08:00,639
and uh but then if you talking about

3126
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:04,079
other intelligent entities for which

3127
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:06,360
the you know the the basic things that

3128
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:07,960
are easy to them is very

3129
02:08:07,960 --> 02:08:11,400
different then it doesn't mean anything

3130
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:17,119
so intelligence is a collection of

3131
02:08:17,119 --> 02:08:19,760
skills and an ability to acquire new

3132
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:22,960
skills efficiently mhm

3133
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:25,960
right and the collection of skills that

3134
02:08:25,960 --> 02:08:27,480
an need intelligent particular

3135
02:08:27,480 --> 02:08:30,559
intelligent entity possess or is capable

3136
02:08:30,559 --> 02:08:32,760
of learning quickly is different from

3137
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:35,360
the collection skills of another one and

3138
02:08:35,360 --> 02:08:37,280
because it's a multi-dimensional thing

3139
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,719
the set of skills is high dimensional

3140
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:41,199
space you can't measure you can compare

3141
02:08:41,199 --> 02:08:43,119
you cannot compare two things as to

3142
02:08:43,119 --> 02:08:44,559
whether one is more intelligent than the

3143
02:08:44,559 --> 02:08:47,400
other it's

3144
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:50,920
multi-dimensional so you push back

3145
02:08:50,920 --> 02:08:55,679
against what are called AI doomers a lot

3146
02:08:55,679 --> 02:08:57,880
uh can you explain their perspective and

3147
02:08:57,880 --> 02:09:00,440
why you think they're wrong okay so a I

3148
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:02,800
doomers imagine all kinds of catastrophe

3149
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:06,520
scenarios of how AI could Escape or

3150
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:09,920
control and basically kill us

3151
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:13,119
all uh and that relies on a whole bunch

3152
02:09:13,119 --> 02:09:15,559
of assumptions that are mostly

3153
02:09:15,559 --> 02:09:18,679
false so the first assumption is that

3154
02:09:18,679 --> 02:09:20,079
the emergence of super intelligence is

3155
02:09:20,079 --> 02:09:21,079
going to be an

3156
02:09:21,079 --> 02:09:23,159
event that at some point we're going to

3157
02:09:23,159 --> 02:09:24,559
have we're going to figure out the

3158
02:09:24,559 --> 02:09:26,360
secret and we'll turn on a machine that

3159
02:09:26,360 --> 02:09:27,360
is super

3160
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:29,800
intelligent and because we've never done

3161
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:31,079
it before it's going to take over the

3162
02:09:31,079 --> 02:09:33,920
world and kill us all that is false it's

3163
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:36,119
not going to be an event we're going to

3164
02:09:36,119 --> 02:09:38,920
have systems that are like as smart as a

3165
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:40,679
cat has all the have all the

3166
02:09:40,679 --> 02:09:43,800
characteristics of you know human level

3167
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:45,440
intelligence but their level of

3168
02:09:45,440 --> 02:09:47,639
intelligence would be like a cat or a

3169
02:09:47,639 --> 02:09:49,040
pirrot maybe

3170
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:49,760
or

3171
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:52,199
something um and then we're going to

3172
02:09:52,199 --> 02:09:54,440
work our way up to kind of make those

3173
02:09:54,440 --> 02:09:55,880
things more intelligent and as we make

3174
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:57,119
them more intelligent we're also going

3175
02:09:57,119 --> 02:09:58,559
to put some guard rails in them and

3176
02:09:58,559 --> 02:10:00,040
learn how to kind of put some guard

3177
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:02,040
rails so they behave properly and we're

3178
02:10:02,040 --> 02:10:03,800
not going to do this with just one it's

3179
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:05,000
not going to be one effort there's going

3180
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,719
to be lots of different people doing

3181
02:10:06,719 --> 02:10:08,679
this and some of them are going to

3182
02:10:08,679 --> 02:10:10,599
succeed at making intelligent systems

3183
02:10:10,599 --> 02:10:13,159
that are uh controllable and safe and

3184
02:10:13,159 --> 02:10:14,920
have the right guard rails and if some

3185
02:10:14,920 --> 02:10:17,760
other goes wrog then we can use the the

3186
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:20,159
good ones to go against the Rogue ones

3187
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:22,440
uh so it's going to be my you know smart

3188
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:25,599
AI police against your Rogue AI um so

3189
02:10:25,599 --> 02:10:26,719
it's not going to be like you know we're

3190
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:28,320
going to be exposed to like a single

3191
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:29,840
Rogue AI that's going to kill us all

3192
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:32,159
that's just not not happening now there

3193
02:10:32,159 --> 02:10:34,040
is another fallacy which is the fact

3194
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,239
that because the system is intelligent

3195
02:10:36,239 --> 02:10:40,599
it necessarily wants to take over MH um

3196
02:10:40,599 --> 02:10:42,360
and there is several

3197
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:44,760
arguments that make people scare of this

3198
02:10:44,760 --> 02:10:48,040
which I think are completely false uh as

3199
02:10:48,040 --> 02:10:52,320
well so one of them is um you know in

3200
02:10:52,320 --> 02:10:54,520
nature it seems to be that the more

3201
02:10:54,520 --> 02:10:56,320
intelligent species otherwi that end up

3202
02:10:56,320 --> 02:11:00,320
dominating the other and uh and

3203
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:03,520
even you know extinguishing the others

3204
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:07,040
uh sometimes by Design sometimes just by

3205
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:08,599
mistake

3206
02:11:08,599 --> 02:11:12,599
and and so you know there is sort of uh

3207
02:11:12,599 --> 02:11:15,520
Thinking by which you say well if AI

3208
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:17,280
systems are more intelligent than us

3209
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:19,920
surely they're going to eliminate us if

3210
02:11:19,920 --> 02:11:22,360
not by Design simply because they don't

3211
02:11:22,360 --> 02:11:24,719
care about us and that's just

3212
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:27,480
Preposterous for for a number of reasons

3213
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:29,079
um first reason is they're not going to

3214
02:11:29,079 --> 02:11:30,840
be a species they're not going to be a

3215
02:11:30,840 --> 02:11:33,280
species that competes with us they're

3216
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:35,400
not going to have the desire to dominate

3217
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:36,800
because the desire to dominate is

3218
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:39,800
something that has to be hardwired into

3219
02:11:39,800 --> 02:11:41,000
an intelligent

3220
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,520
system uh it is hardwired in

3221
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:46,199
humans it is hardwired in baboons in

3222
02:11:46,199 --> 02:11:48,719
chimpanzees in wolves

3223
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:50,280
not in a wrong

3224
02:11:50,280 --> 02:11:54,599
Tes the species in which this desire to

3225
02:11:54,599 --> 02:11:58,040
dominate or submit or or attain status

3226
02:11:58,040 --> 02:11:59,400
in other

3227
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:03,199
ways is is specific to social species

3228
02:12:03,199 --> 02:12:05,280
non-social species like our tongs don't

3229
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:07,559
have it right and they are as smart as

3230
02:12:07,559 --> 02:12:10,920
we are almost right and to you there's

3231
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:12,719
not significant incentive for humans to

3232
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:15,679
encode that into the AI systems and to

3233
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:20,159
the degree they do there'll be AIS that

3234
02:12:20,159 --> 02:12:22,159
um sort of punish them for it I'll

3235
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:23,559
compete them over well there's all kinds

3236
02:12:23,559 --> 02:12:25,159
of incentive to make AI system

3237
02:12:25,159 --> 02:12:27,639
submissive to humans right right I mean

3238
02:12:27,639 --> 02:12:28,559
this is the way we're going to build

3239
02:12:28,559 --> 02:12:31,639
them right um and so so then people say

3240
02:12:31,639 --> 02:12:33,280
oh but look at llms LMS are not

3241
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:35,400
controllable and they're right LMS are

3242
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:37,880
not controllable but objective driven AI

3243
02:12:37,880 --> 02:12:41,679
so systems that derive their Answers by

3244
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:44,159
optimization of an objective means they

3245
02:12:44,159 --> 02:12:45,960
have to optimize this objective and that

3246
02:12:45,960 --> 02:12:48,360
objective can include guard rails one

3247
02:12:48,360 --> 02:12:52,960
guardrail is uh obey humans another

3248
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:55,400
guardrail is don't obey humans if it's

3249
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:57,960
hurting other humans with I've heard

3250
02:12:57,960 --> 02:13:00,000
that before somewhere I don't remember

3251
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,920
yes maybe in a book yeah uh but speaking

3252
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:05,920
of that book what is could there be

3253
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:08,440
unintended consequences also from all of

3254
02:13:08,440 --> 02:13:11,520
this no of course uh so this is not a

3255
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:13,679
simple problem right I mean uh designing

3256
02:13:13,679 --> 02:13:15,159
those guard rail so that the system

3257
02:13:15,159 --> 02:13:17,159
behaves properly is not going to be a a

3258
02:13:17,159 --> 02:13:19,040
simple

3259
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:21,360
uh issue that for which there is a

3260
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:22,960
silver bullet for which you have a

3261
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:24,520
mathematical proof that the system can

3262
02:13:24,520 --> 02:13:26,679
be safe it's going to be very

3263
02:13:26,679 --> 02:13:28,599
Progressive iterative design system

3264
02:13:28,599 --> 02:13:31,480
where we put those guard rails in such a

3265
02:13:31,480 --> 02:13:33,159
way that the system behave properly and

3266
02:13:33,159 --> 02:13:35,119
sometimes they're going to do something

3267
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:37,400
that you know was unexpected because the

3268
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:38,639
guardare wasn't right and we're going to

3269
02:13:38,639 --> 02:13:41,000
correct them so that they do it right uh

3270
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,119
the idea somehow that we can't get it

3271
02:13:43,119 --> 02:13:44,719
slightly wrong because if we get it

3272
02:13:44,719 --> 02:13:47,079
slightly wrong we all die is is

3273
02:13:47,079 --> 02:13:48,639
ridiculous

3274
02:13:48,639 --> 02:13:50,400
um we we're just going to go

3275
02:13:50,400 --> 02:13:52,280
progressively and it's it's just going

3276
02:13:52,280 --> 02:13:54,719
to be the the analogy I've used many

3277
02:13:54,719 --> 02:14:00,760
times is um is uh turbojet design um how

3278
02:14:00,760 --> 02:14:02,520
how did we figure out how to make

3279
02:14:02,520 --> 02:14:06,719
turbojet so unbelievably reliable right

3280
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:08,119
uh I mean those are like you know

3281
02:14:08,119 --> 02:14:11,119
incredibly complex uh pieces of Hardware

3282
02:14:11,119 --> 02:14:13,639
that run at really high temperatures for

3283
02:14:13,639 --> 02:14:17,599
you know 20 20 hours at a time sometimes

3284
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:20,199
and we can you know fly halfway around

3285
02:14:20,199 --> 02:14:22,440
the world with a on a two

3286
02:14:22,440 --> 02:14:24,000
engine

3287
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,199
uh jetliner at near the speed of sound

3288
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:29,280
like how incredible is this it's just

3289
02:14:29,280 --> 02:14:31,760
unbelievable right

3290
02:14:31,760 --> 02:14:34,520
and did we do this because we invented

3291
02:14:34,520 --> 02:14:36,239
like a general principle of how to make

3292
02:14:36,239 --> 02:14:39,040
Turbo Jet safe no we it took decades to

3293
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:40,520
kind of fine-tune the design of those

3294
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:43,880
systems so that they they were safe is

3295
02:14:43,880 --> 02:14:48,440
there a separate uh group Within General

3296
02:14:48,440 --> 02:14:51,760
Electric or snma or whatever that is

3297
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:56,040
specialized in turo jet safety no it's

3298
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:59,280
the design is all about safety because a

3299
02:14:59,280 --> 02:15:01,000
better Turbo Jet is also a safer Turbo

3300
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,760
Jet so um a more reliable one it's the

3301
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:06,599
same for AI like do you do you need you

3302
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:08,520
know specific Provisions to make AI safe

3303
02:15:08,520 --> 02:15:10,400
no you need to make better AI systems

3304
02:15:10,400 --> 02:15:12,280
and they will be safe because they are

3305
02:15:12,280 --> 02:15:14,000
designed to be more

3306
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:17,199
useful uh and more controllable so let's

3307
02:15:17,199 --> 02:15:19,719
imagine a system AI system that's able

3308
02:15:19,719 --> 02:15:22,239
to be incredibly

3309
02:15:22,239 --> 02:15:24,960
convincing and can convince you of

3310
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:28,280
anything I I can at least imagine such a

3311
02:15:28,280 --> 02:15:31,599
system and I can see such a system

3312
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:34,800
be weapon-like because it can control

3313
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:37,320
people's minds we're pretty gullible we

3314
02:15:37,320 --> 02:15:39,079
we want to believe a thing you can have

3315
02:15:39,079 --> 02:15:41,239
an A system that controls it and you

3316
02:15:41,239 --> 02:15:43,800
could see governments using that as a

3317
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:46,599
weapon so do you think if you imagine

3318
02:15:46,599 --> 02:15:48,599
such a system

3319
02:15:48,599 --> 02:15:51,360
there's any parallel to something like

3320
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:57,480
nuclear weapons no so is why why why is

3321
02:15:57,480 --> 02:15:59,000
that technology different so you're

3322
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:00,480
saying there's going to be gradual

3323
02:16:00,480 --> 02:16:03,159
development yeah there's going to be I

3324
02:16:03,159 --> 02:16:04,880
mean it might be rapid but they'll be

3325
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:07,000
iterative and then we'll be able to kind

3326
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,800
of respond and and so on so that AI

3327
02:16:09,800 --> 02:16:12,119
system designed by Vladimir Putin or

3328
02:16:12,119 --> 02:16:17,040
whatever or his uh minions uh you know

3329
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:20,199
is going to be uh like talking to trying

3330
02:16:20,199 --> 02:16:22,800
to talk to every American to uh convince

3331
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:26,159
them to vote for you know whoever

3332
02:16:26,159 --> 02:16:30,559
whoever pleases Putin sure uh or

3333
02:16:30,559 --> 02:16:34,558
whatever or or you know or R people up

3334
02:16:34,558 --> 02:16:37,200
against each other um as they've been

3335
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:38,120
trying to

3336
02:16:38,120 --> 02:16:40,599
do they're not going to be talking to

3337
02:16:40,599 --> 02:16:42,120
you they're going to be talking to your

3338
02:16:42,120 --> 02:16:45,558
AI assistant mhm which is going to be as

3339
02:16:45,558 --> 02:16:49,000
smart as theirs MH right right that AI

3340
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:51,240
because as I said in the future every

3341
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:52,679
single one of your interaction with the

3342
02:16:52,679 --> 02:16:54,718
digital world will be mediated by your

3343
02:16:54,718 --> 02:16:56,318
AI assistant so the first thing you're

3344
02:16:56,318 --> 02:16:58,920
going to ask is is this a scam like is

3345
02:16:58,920 --> 02:17:00,679
this thing like telling me the truth

3346
02:17:00,679 --> 02:17:02,599
like it's not even going to be able to

3347
02:17:02,599 --> 02:17:04,599
get to you because it's only going to

3348
02:17:04,599 --> 02:17:06,120
talk to your AI assistant and your AI

3349
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:08,599
assistant is not not even going to it's

3350
02:17:08,599 --> 02:17:10,599
going to be like a spam filter right

3351
02:17:10,599 --> 02:17:12,799
you're not even seeing the email the

3352
02:17:12,799 --> 02:17:15,000
spam email right it's automatically put

3353
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:17,318
in a folder that you never see um it's

3354
02:17:17,318 --> 02:17:19,799
going to be same thing that AI system

3355
02:17:19,799 --> 02:17:21,398
that tries to convince you of something

3356
02:17:21,398 --> 02:17:23,160
is going to be talking to a assistant

3357
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:24,478
which is going to be at least as smart

3358
02:17:24,478 --> 02:17:25,359
as

3359
02:17:25,359 --> 02:17:28,638
it and is going to say this is spam you

3360
02:17:28,638 --> 02:17:31,160
know U it's not even going to bring it

3361
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:33,679
to your attention so to you it's very

3362
02:17:33,679 --> 02:17:35,519
difficult for any one AI system to take

3363
02:17:35,519 --> 02:17:37,879
such a big leap ahead to where it can

3364
02:17:37,879 --> 02:17:40,160
convince even the other AI systems so

3365
02:17:40,160 --> 02:17:42,959
like it there's always going to be this

3366
02:17:42,959 --> 02:17:46,679
kind of race where nobody's way ahead

3367
02:17:46,679 --> 02:17:49,040
that's the history of the world history

3368
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:50,519
of the world is you know whenever there

3369
02:17:50,519 --> 02:17:53,120
is a prog at some someplace there is a

3370
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:56,240
countermeasure and and you know it's a

3371
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:58,359
it's a Katan mous game well this is why

3372
02:17:58,359 --> 02:18:00,280
mostly yes but this is why nuclear

3373
02:18:00,280 --> 02:18:02,478
weapons are so interesting because that

3374
02:18:02,478 --> 02:18:05,599
was such a powerful weapon that it

3375
02:18:05,599 --> 02:18:07,519
mattered who got it

3376
02:18:07,519 --> 02:18:11,080
first that you know you could imagine

3377
02:18:11,080 --> 02:18:14,000
Hitler

3378
02:18:14,359 --> 02:18:17,840
Stalin ma getting the weapon first and

3379
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:19,679
that that having a different kind of

3380
02:18:19,679 --> 02:18:22,040
impact on the world than than the United

3381
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:24,519
States getting the weapon first but to

3382
02:18:24,519 --> 02:18:27,959
you nuclear weapons is is like you you

3383
02:18:27,959 --> 02:18:31,679
don't imagine a uh breakthrough

3384
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:33,718
Discovery and then Manhattan Project

3385
02:18:33,718 --> 02:18:37,920
like effort for AI no as I said it's not

3386
02:18:37,920 --> 02:18:40,080
going to be an event it's going to be

3387
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:43,599
you know continuous progress and and

3388
02:18:43,599 --> 02:18:45,558
whenever you know one breakthrough

3389
02:18:45,558 --> 02:18:46,920
occurs it's going to be widely

3390
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:48,959
disseminated really quickly yeah

3391
02:18:48,959 --> 02:18:51,240
probably first within industry I mean

3392
02:18:51,240 --> 02:18:53,799
this is not a domain where you know

3393
02:18:53,799 --> 02:18:56,000
government or military organizations are

3394
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,200
particularly Innovative and they're in

3395
02:18:58,200 --> 02:19:01,318
fact way behind um and so this is going

3396
02:19:01,318 --> 02:19:03,359
to come from industry and and this kind

3397
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:05,000
of information disseminates extremely

3398
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:07,080
quickly we've seen this over the last

3399
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:10,240
few years right where you have a new

3400
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:12,240
like you know even take alphao this was

3401
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:13,840
reproduced within three

3402
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:16,280
months even without like particularly

3403
02:19:16,280 --> 02:19:18,359
detailed information right yeah this is

3404
02:19:18,359 --> 02:19:21,280
an industry that's not good at secrecy

3405
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:23,318
no but even even if there is just the

3406
02:19:23,318 --> 02:19:24,599
fact that you know that something is

3407
02:19:24,599 --> 02:19:28,879
possible yeah uh makes you like realize

3408
02:19:28,879 --> 02:19:30,318
that it's worth investing the time to

3409
02:19:30,318 --> 02:19:32,200
actually do it you you may be the second

3410
02:19:32,200 --> 02:19:34,398
person to do it but you know you'll

3411
02:19:34,398 --> 02:19:38,760
you'll do it uh and you know same for

3412
02:19:38,760 --> 02:19:42,120
you know all the Innovations you know

3413
02:19:42,120 --> 02:19:44,478
self supervisor Transformers decoder

3414
02:19:44,478 --> 02:19:46,679
only architectures llms I mean those

3415
02:19:46,679 --> 02:19:48,720
things you don't need to know exactly

3416
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:50,200
the details of how they work to know

3417
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:51,439
that you know it's

3418
02:19:51,439 --> 02:19:53,520
possible um because it's deployed and

3419
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:55,560
then it's getting reproduced and then

3420
02:19:55,560 --> 02:19:58,160
you know people who work for those

3421
02:19:58,160 --> 02:20:01,200
companies move they go from one company

3422
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:04,160
to another and you know the information

3423
02:20:04,160 --> 02:20:07,680
disseminates what makes the success of

3424
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:10,120
the the US tech industry and Silicon

3425
02:20:10,120 --> 02:20:11,840
Valley in particular is exactly that is

3426
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:13,240
because information circulates really

3427
02:20:13,240 --> 02:20:15,439
really quickly and this you know

3428
02:20:15,439 --> 02:20:18,160
disseminates very quickly and so you

3429
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:21,280
know the the whole region sort of is

3430
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:23,479
ahead because of that circulation of

3431
02:20:23,479 --> 02:20:26,520
information so maybe I just to linger on

3432
02:20:26,520 --> 02:20:29,920
the psychology of AI doomers you give uh

3433
02:20:29,920 --> 02:20:32,160
in the classic Yan laon way a pretty

3434
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,920
good example of just when a a new

3435
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:38,520
technology comes to be you say uh

3436
02:20:38,520 --> 02:20:41,200
engineer says I invented this new thing

3437
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:43,280
I call it a

3438
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:45,760
ballpen and then the Twitter sphere

3439
02:20:45,760 --> 02:20:48,319
responds OMG people could write horrible

3440
02:20:48,319 --> 02:20:49,840
things with it like misinformation

3441
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:53,080
propaganda Hast speech ban it now then

3442
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:54,840
writing doomers come

3443
02:20:54,840 --> 02:20:58,319
in akin to the AI doomers imagine if

3444
02:20:58,319 --> 02:21:01,240
everyone can get a ballpen this could

3445
02:21:01,240 --> 02:21:03,000
destroy Society there should be a law

3446
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,720
against using ballpen to write hate

3447
02:21:04,720 --> 02:21:07,520
speech regulate ballpens now and then

3448
02:21:07,520 --> 02:21:10,760
the pencil industry Mogul says yeah

3449
02:21:10,760 --> 02:21:13,560
ballpens are very dangerous unlike

3450
02:21:13,560 --> 02:21:16,760
pencil writing which is erasable ballpen

3451
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:19,120
writing stays forever government should

3452
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:21,600
require a license for a pen

3453
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:24,800
manufacturer I mean this does seem to be

3454
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:27,160
part of um human

3455
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:30,399
psychology when when it comes up against

3456
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:31,200
new

3457
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:35,319
technology so what what deep insights

3458
02:21:35,319 --> 02:21:37,960
can you speak to about this well there

3459
02:21:37,960 --> 02:21:43,399
is a a natural fear of uh new technology

3460
02:21:43,399 --> 02:21:45,280
and the impact it can have in society

3461
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:48,319
and people have kind of instinctive

3462
02:21:48,319 --> 02:21:52,160
reaction to um you know the world they

3463
02:21:52,160 --> 02:21:55,120
know being threatened by Major

3464
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:57,240
Transformations um that are either

3465
02:21:57,240 --> 02:22:01,040
cultural phenomena or technological um

3466
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:04,160
revolutions and they fear for their

3467
02:22:04,160 --> 02:22:05,720
culture they feel for their job they

3468
02:22:05,720 --> 02:22:08,200
feel for they fear for their you know

3469
02:22:08,200 --> 02:22:12,200
the future of their children um and uh

3470
02:22:12,200 --> 02:22:16,080
their way of life right so so any change

3471
02:22:16,080 --> 02:22:18,040
um is feared and

3472
02:22:18,040 --> 02:22:20,319
and you see this you know long history

3473
02:22:20,319 --> 02:22:22,800
like any technological Revolution or

3474
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:24,840
cultural phenomenon was always

3475
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:29,040
accompanied by uh you know groups or

3476
02:22:29,040 --> 02:22:30,319
reaction in the

3477
02:22:30,319 --> 02:22:33,800
media uh that that basically

3478
02:22:33,800 --> 02:22:36,399
attributed the all the problems the

3479
02:22:36,399 --> 02:22:38,399
current problems of society to that

3480
02:22:38,399 --> 02:22:41,399
particular change right electricity was

3481
02:22:41,399 --> 02:22:44,439
going to kill everyone at some point you

3482
02:22:44,439 --> 02:22:47,280
know you uh the train was going to be a

3483
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:48,560
horrible thing because you know you

3484
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:52,240
can't breathe past 50 kilm an hour um

3485
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:53,920
and so there's a wonderful website

3486
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:55,439
called a pessimist

3487
02:22:55,439 --> 02:22:58,399
archive right which has all those

3488
02:22:58,399 --> 02:23:00,840
newspaper clips of all the horrible

3489
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:02,760
things people imagine would would arrive

3490
02:23:02,760 --> 02:23:06,800
because of uh either technological uh

3491
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:10,399
Innovation or uh a cultural phenomenon

3492
02:23:10,399 --> 02:23:11,960
um you

3493
02:23:11,960 --> 02:23:15,680
know the this is wonderful examples of

3494
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:19,720
uh uh you know jazz or comic books being

3495
02:23:19,720 --> 02:23:20,920
blamed

3496
02:23:20,920 --> 02:23:24,319
for uh unemployment or or you know young

3497
02:23:24,319 --> 02:23:26,399
people not wanting to work anymore and

3498
02:23:26,399 --> 02:23:28,560
things like that right and and that has

3499
02:23:28,560 --> 02:23:31,120
existed for for

3500
02:23:31,120 --> 02:23:36,800
centuries um and it's you know knee-jerk

3501
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:39,479
reactions um the question is you know do

3502
02:23:39,479 --> 02:23:41,080
we Embrace

3503
02:23:41,080 --> 02:23:45,040
change uh or do we resist it

3504
02:23:45,040 --> 02:23:47,560
and what are the real dangers as opposed

3505
02:23:47,560 --> 02:23:50,680
to the imagined uh imagined

3506
02:23:50,680 --> 02:23:54,479
ones so people worry about I think one

3507
02:23:54,479 --> 02:23:55,840
thing they worry about with big Tech

3508
02:23:55,840 --> 02:23:57,399
something we've been talking about over

3509
02:23:57,399 --> 02:24:00,000
and over but I think

3510
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,240
worth mentioning again they worry about

3511
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:06,439
how powerful AI will be and they worry

3512
02:24:06,439 --> 02:24:09,000
about it being in the hands of one

3513
02:24:09,000 --> 02:24:11,399
centralized power of just a handful of

3514
02:24:11,399 --> 02:24:14,319
central control and so that's the

3515
02:24:14,319 --> 02:24:16,520
skepticism with big Tech you can make

3516
02:24:16,520 --> 02:24:18,000
these companies can make a huge amount

3517
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:22,600
of money and control this technology and

3518
02:24:22,600 --> 02:24:26,600
by so doing you know take advantage uh

3519
02:24:26,600 --> 02:24:29,160
abuse the little guy in society well

3520
02:24:29,160 --> 02:24:30,880
that's exactly why we need open source

3521
02:24:30,880 --> 02:24:34,080
platforms yeah I just wanted

3522
02:24:34,080 --> 02:24:37,560
to nail the point home more and more yes

3523
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:41,040
um so let me ask you on your like I said

3524
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:44,399
you do get a little bit uh um you know

3525
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:46,960
flavorful on the internet uh yos

3526
02:24:46,960 --> 02:24:49,240
shabbach tweeted something that you

3527
02:24:49,240 --> 02:24:53,880
loled at uh in reference to H 9000 quote

3528
02:24:53,880 --> 02:24:56,439
I appreciate your argument and I fully

3529
02:24:56,439 --> 02:24:58,200
understand your frustration but whether

3530
02:24:58,200 --> 02:25:00,600
the pod bay doors should be opened or

3531
02:25:00,600 --> 02:25:04,000
closed is a complex and nuanced issue so

3532
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,800
you're at the head of meta

3533
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:10,000
AI um you know this is something that

3534
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:14,359
really worries me that AI our AI

3535
02:25:14,359 --> 02:25:16,920
overlords will speak down to us with

3536
02:25:16,920 --> 02:25:20,840
corporate speak um of this nature and

3537
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:22,880
you sort of resist that with your way of

3538
02:25:22,880 --> 02:25:25,880
being um is this something you can just

3539
02:25:25,880 --> 02:25:28,680
comment on of working at a big

3540
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:30,720
company how you

3541
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:33,439
can avoid

3542
02:25:33,439 --> 02:25:36,920
the over fearing I

3543
02:25:36,920 --> 02:25:41,439
suppose the through caution create harm

3544
02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:45,000
yeah again I think the answer to this is

3545
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:46,840
open source platforms and then en

3546
02:25:46,840 --> 02:25:50,520
enabling a widely diverse set of people

3547
02:25:50,520 --> 02:25:52,840
to build AI

3548
02:25:52,840 --> 02:25:55,600
assistance that represent the diversity

3549
02:25:55,600 --> 02:25:57,960
of uh cultures opinions languages and

3550
02:25:57,960 --> 02:26:00,160
value systems across the world um so

3551
02:26:00,160 --> 02:26:03,200
that you're not bound to just uh you

3552
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:06,359
know be brainwashed by a particular way

3553
02:26:06,359 --> 02:26:10,479
of thinking because of single AI entity

3554
02:26:10,479 --> 02:26:12,840
um so I mean I I think it's really

3555
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:14,880
really important question for society

3556
02:26:14,880 --> 02:26:17,560
and the problem I'm seeing is

3557
02:26:17,560 --> 02:26:21,240
um is that um which is why I've been so

3558
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:24,760
vocal and sometimes a little sardonic

3559
02:26:24,760 --> 02:26:27,600
about it never stop never stop

3560
02:26:27,600 --> 02:26:30,840
Yan we love it is because I see the

3561
02:26:30,840 --> 02:26:32,960
danger of this concentration of power

3562
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:36,359
through through proprietary AI systems

3563
02:26:36,359 --> 02:26:38,960
has a much bigger danger than everything

3564
02:26:38,960 --> 02:26:43,680
else that if we really want you know uh

3565
02:26:43,680 --> 02:26:47,399
diversity of opinion uh AI systems that

3566
02:26:47,399 --> 02:26:49,560
you know in in this future that where

3567
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:51,840
we'll all be interacting through AI

3568
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:54,399
systems we need those to be diverse for

3569
02:26:54,399 --> 02:26:57,800
the preservation of uh uh diversity of

3570
02:26:57,800 --> 02:27:01,520
ideas and you know Creeds and political

3571
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:04,000
opinions and and and

3572
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,040
whatever uh and the preservation of

3573
02:27:07,040 --> 02:27:08,720
democracy

3574
02:27:08,720 --> 02:27:12,640
and what works against this is people

3575
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:15,840
who think that for reasons of security

3576
02:27:15,840 --> 02:27:18,359
we should keep AI systems under lock and

3577
02:27:18,359 --> 02:27:20,520
key because it's too dangerous to put it

3578
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:22,880
in the hands of of

3579
02:27:22,880 --> 02:27:25,040
everybody um because it could be used by

3580
02:27:25,040 --> 02:27:27,880
terrorists or something

3581
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:30,319
um that would lead

3582
02:27:30,319 --> 02:27:34,920
to uh you know potentially a uh a very

3583
02:27:34,920 --> 02:27:37,640
bad future in which all of our

3584
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:39,319
information diet is controlled by a

3585
02:27:39,319 --> 02:27:41,840
small number of uh companies through

3586
02:27:41,840 --> 02:27:43,120
proprietary

3587
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:46,840
systems do you trust humans with this

3588
02:27:46,840 --> 02:27:50,600
technology to uh to build systems that

3589
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:53,520
are on the whole good for Humanity isn't

3590
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:55,760
that what democracy and free speech is

3591
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:58,200
all about I think so do you trust

3592
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:00,399
institutions to do the right thing do

3593
02:28:00,399 --> 02:28:03,120
you trust people to do the right thing

3594
02:28:03,120 --> 02:28:04,479
and and yeah there's bad people who are

3595
02:28:04,479 --> 02:28:06,200
going to do bad things but they're not

3596
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:07,920
going to have Superior technology to the

3597
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:09,680
good people so then it's going to be my

3598
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:12,680
good AI against your bad AI right I mean

3599
02:28:12,680 --> 02:28:15,600
there the examples that we were just

3600
02:28:15,600 --> 02:28:18,279
talking about of you you know maybe uh

3601
02:28:18,279 --> 02:28:20,520
some Rogue country will build you know

3602
02:28:20,520 --> 02:28:22,840
some AI system that's going to try to

3603
02:28:22,840 --> 02:28:24,680
convince everybody

3604
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:27,680
to go into a civil war or something or

3605
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:33,240
or or elect a favorable U ruler and um

3606
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:34,800
but then they will have to go past our

3607
02:28:34,800 --> 02:28:37,640
AI systems right an AI system with a

3608
02:28:37,640 --> 02:28:39,120
strong Russian accent will be trying to

3609
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:42,200
conv our and doesn't put any uh articles

3610
02:28:42,200 --> 02:28:44,040
in their

3611
02:28:44,040 --> 02:28:47,319
sentences um well it'll be at the very

3612
02:28:47,319 --> 02:28:50,880
least absurdly comedic okay uh

3613
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:53,760
so I uh since we talked about sort of

3614
02:28:53,760 --> 02:28:56,120
the uh physical reality I'd love to ask

3615
02:28:56,120 --> 02:28:58,560
your vision of the future with with

3616
02:28:58,560 --> 02:29:00,880
robots in in this physical reality so

3617
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:03,520
many of the kinds of intelligence you've

3618
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:06,560
been speaking about would Empower robots

3619
02:29:06,560 --> 02:29:09,439
to be more effective collaborators with

3620
02:29:09,439 --> 02:29:13,680
us humans so um since uh Tesla's Optimus

3621
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:15,279
uh team has been showing off some

3622
02:29:15,279 --> 02:29:17,080
progress on humanoid robots

3623
02:29:17,080 --> 02:29:19,319
I think it really reinvigorated the

3624
02:29:19,319 --> 02:29:21,240
whole industry that's that I think

3625
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:23,000
Boston Dynamics has been leading for a

3626
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:24,840
very very long time so now there's all

3627
02:29:24,840 --> 02:29:27,399
kinds of companies figure AI obviously

3628
02:29:27,399 --> 02:29:32,160
Boston Dynamics um un tree un tree uh

3629
02:29:32,160 --> 02:29:33,720
but there's like a lot of them it's

3630
02:29:33,720 --> 02:29:38,600
great it's great I mean I love it uh so

3631
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:41,479
do you think there'll be uh millions of

3632
02:29:41,479 --> 02:29:44,120
humanoid robots walking around soon not

3633
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:45,920
soon but it's going to it's going to

3634
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:47,359
happen like the next decade I think is

3635
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:49,560
going to be really interesting in robots

3636
02:29:49,560 --> 02:29:53,120
like the the emergence of the robotics

3637
02:29:53,120 --> 02:29:56,399
industry has been in the waiting for you

3638
02:29:56,399 --> 02:29:58,640
know 10 20 years without really emerging

3639
02:29:58,640 --> 02:30:00,640
other than for like you know kind of

3640
02:30:00,640 --> 02:30:03,240
preprogram behavior and stuff like that

3641
02:30:03,240 --> 02:30:07,680
um and uh and the main issue is again

3642
02:30:07,680 --> 02:30:09,120
the Maric Paradox like you know how do

3643
02:30:09,120 --> 02:30:10,399
we get those system to understand how

3644
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:12,319
the world works and and kind of you know

3645
02:30:12,319 --> 02:30:14,279
plan actions and so we can do it for

3646
02:30:14,279 --> 02:30:19,319
really specialized tasks um and uh the

3647
02:30:19,319 --> 02:30:21,560
way Boston Dynamics goes about it is you

3648
02:30:21,560 --> 02:30:23,600
know basically with a lot of um

3649
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:27,240
handcrafted dynamical models and careful

3650
02:30:27,240 --> 02:30:29,720
planning uh in advance which is very

3651
02:30:29,720 --> 02:30:31,240
classical robotics with a lot of

3652
02:30:31,240 --> 02:30:34,160
innovation a little bit of perception um

3653
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:36,479
but it's still not like they can't build

3654
02:30:36,479 --> 02:30:41,880
a domestic robot right um and you know

3655
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:44,000
we're still some distance away from

3656
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,439
completely autonomous level five driving

3657
02:30:46,439 --> 02:30:49,439
mhm uh and we're certainly very far away

3658
02:30:49,439 --> 02:30:52,319
from having uh you know level five

3659
02:30:52,319 --> 02:30:54,399
autonomous driving bi A system that can

3660
02:30:54,399 --> 02:30:58,240
train Itself by driving 20 hours like

3661
02:30:58,240 --> 02:30:59,800
any 17y

3662
02:30:59,800 --> 02:31:03,880
old uh so until we

3663
02:31:03,880 --> 02:31:08,479
have uh again World models systems that

3664
02:31:08,479 --> 02:31:10,200
can train themselves to understand how

3665
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:11,479
the world

3666
02:31:11,479 --> 02:31:13,880
Works uh we're not going to we're not

3667
02:31:13,880 --> 02:31:16,000
going to have significant progress in

3668
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:16,960
robotic

3669
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:19,560
so a lot of the people working on

3670
02:31:19,560 --> 02:31:22,240
robotic Hardware at the moment are are

3671
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:25,560
betting or banking on the fact that AI

3672
02:31:25,560 --> 02:31:26,920
is going to make sufficient progress

3673
02:31:26,920 --> 02:31:29,240
towards that and they're hoping to

3674
02:31:29,240 --> 02:31:32,560
discover a product in it too is uh yeah

3675
02:31:32,560 --> 02:31:34,200
before you have a really strong World

3676
02:31:34,200 --> 02:31:37,080
model there'll be an almost Strong World

3677
02:31:37,080 --> 02:31:40,960
model and um people are trying to find a

3678
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:43,880
product in a clumsy robot I suppose like

3679
02:31:43,880 --> 02:31:45,800
not a perfectly efficient robot so

3680
02:31:45,800 --> 02:31:47,359
there's the fact factory setting where

3681
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:49,399
uh humanoid robots can help automate

3682
02:31:49,399 --> 02:31:51,560
some aspects of the factory I think

3683
02:31:51,560 --> 02:31:53,720
that's a crazy difficult task because of

3684
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:55,240
all the safety required and all this

3685
02:31:55,240 --> 02:31:57,279
kind of stuff I think in the home is

3686
02:31:57,279 --> 02:31:59,399
more interesting but then you start to

3687
02:31:59,399 --> 02:32:01,800
think I think you mentioned loading the

3688
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:05,000
dishwasher right yeah like I suppose

3689
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:06,720
that's one of the main problems you're

3690
02:32:06,720 --> 02:32:09,800
working on I mean there's you know uh

3691
02:32:09,800 --> 02:32:13,600
cleaning up cleaning the house uh clear

3692
02:32:13,600 --> 02:32:16,960
clearing up the table after

3693
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:19,760
meal washing the dishes you know all

3694
02:32:19,760 --> 02:32:21,800
those tasks you know cooking I mean all

3695
02:32:21,800 --> 02:32:23,319
the tasks that you know in principle

3696
02:32:23,319 --> 02:32:24,680
could be automated but are actually

3697
02:32:24,680 --> 02:32:27,160
incredibly sophisticated really

3698
02:32:27,160 --> 02:32:29,040
complicated but even just basic

3699
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:31,319
navigation around an un Space full of

3700
02:32:31,319 --> 02:32:33,279
uncertainty that's sort of works like

3701
02:32:33,279 --> 02:32:36,000
you can sort of do this now navigation

3702
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:39,439
is fine well navigation in a way that's

3703
02:32:39,439 --> 02:32:41,720
compelling to us humans is is is a

3704
02:32:41,720 --> 02:32:43,640
different thing yeah it's not going to

3705
02:32:43,640 --> 02:32:45,680
be you know necessarily I mean we have

3706
02:32:45,680 --> 02:32:47,560
demos actually because you know there is

3707
02:32:47,560 --> 02:32:52,200
a So-Cal embodied AI group at at fair

3708
02:32:52,200 --> 02:32:54,080
and uh you know they've been not

3709
02:32:54,080 --> 02:32:55,880
building their own robots but using

3710
02:32:55,880 --> 02:32:58,560
commercial robots um and you can you can

3711
02:32:58,560 --> 02:33:01,359
tell a robot dog like you know go to the

3712
02:33:01,359 --> 02:33:03,200
fridge and they can actually open the

3713
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:04,920
fridge and they can probably pick up a

3714
02:33:04,920 --> 02:33:06,680
can in the fridge and stuff like that

3715
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:09,640
and and bring it to you you know so it

3716
02:33:09,640 --> 02:33:13,040
can navigate can grab objects as long as

3717
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:14,920
it's been trying to recognize them which

3718
02:33:14,920 --> 02:33:16,960
you know Vision systems work pretty well

3719
02:33:16,960 --> 02:33:20,120
nowadays um but but it's not like a

3720
02:33:20,120 --> 02:33:22,000
completely you know

3721
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,640
General robot that would be you know

3722
02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:27,600
sophisticated enough to do things like

3723
02:33:27,600 --> 02:33:29,920
clearing up the dinner

3724
02:33:29,920 --> 02:33:32,439
table Yeah to me that's an exciting

3725
02:33:32,439 --> 02:33:35,279
future of getting humanoid robots robots

3726
02:33:35,279 --> 02:33:36,640
in general in the whole more and more

3727
02:33:36,640 --> 02:33:39,080
because that gets uh humans to really

3728
02:33:39,080 --> 02:33:41,240
directly interact with AI systems in the

3729
02:33:41,240 --> 02:33:44,080
physical space and in so doing it allows

3730
02:33:44,080 --> 02:33:45,800
us to philosophically psychologically

3731
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:47,960
explore our relationships with robots

3732
02:33:47,960 --> 02:33:50,680
can be really really really interesting

3733
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:52,640
so I hope you make progress on the whole

3734
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:55,520
uh japa thing soon well I I mean I hope

3735
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:57,560
I hope things kind of you know work as

3736
02:33:57,560 --> 02:33:59,399
uh as planned

3737
02:33:59,399 --> 02:34:02,120
um I mean again we've been kind of

3738
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:03,760
working on this idea of self supervised

3739
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:08,040
learning of from video for for 10 years

3740
02:34:08,040 --> 02:34:10,160
and and you know only made significant

3741
02:34:10,160 --> 02:34:12,200
progress in the last two or three and

3742
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:13,600
actually you've you've mentioned that

3743
02:34:13,600 --> 02:34:14,520
there's a lot of interesting

3744
02:34:14,520 --> 02:34:16,200
breakthroughs that can happen without

3745
02:34:16,200 --> 02:34:18,319
having access to a lot of compute yeah

3746
02:34:18,319 --> 02:34:20,279
so if you're interested in doing a PhD

3747
02:34:20,279 --> 02:34:22,439
and this kind of stuff there's a lot of

3748
02:34:22,439 --> 02:34:24,319
possibilities still yeah to do

3749
02:34:24,319 --> 02:34:26,279
Innovative work so like what advice

3750
02:34:26,279 --> 02:34:28,279
would you give to a undergrad that's

3751
02:34:28,279 --> 02:34:31,399
looking to uh go to grad school and do a

3752
02:34:31,399 --> 02:34:34,200
PhD so basically I've listed them

3753
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:37,080
already uh this idea of how do you train

3754
02:34:37,080 --> 02:34:38,760
a world model by

3755
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:40,720
observation and you don't have to train

3756
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:44,560
necessarily on gigantic data sets

3757
02:34:44,560 --> 02:34:47,000
or I mean you could out to be necessary

3758
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,880
to actually train on large data sets to

3759
02:34:48,880 --> 02:34:50,600
have emerging properties like like we

3760
02:34:50,600 --> 02:34:52,399
have with LMS but I think there's a lot

3761
02:34:52,399 --> 02:34:54,200
of good ideas that can be done

3762
02:34:54,200 --> 02:34:56,840
without necessarily scaling up then

3763
02:34:56,840 --> 02:34:59,160
there is how you do planning with a

3764
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:01,520
learn World model if the world the

3765
02:35:01,520 --> 02:35:03,359
system evolves in is not the physical

3766
02:35:03,359 --> 02:35:06,160
world but it's the world of let's say

3767
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:09,640
the internet or you know some sort of uh

3768
02:35:09,640 --> 02:35:12,160
world of where an action consists in

3769
02:35:12,160 --> 02:35:14,120
doing a search in a search engine or

3770
02:35:14,120 --> 02:35:16,439
interrogating a data database or running

3771
02:35:16,439 --> 02:35:19,760
a simulation or calling a calculator or

3772
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:21,439
solving a differential

3773
02:35:21,439 --> 02:35:23,720
equation how do you get a system to

3774
02:35:23,720 --> 02:35:26,319
actually plan a sequence of actions to

3775
02:35:26,319 --> 02:35:28,960
you know give the solution to a problem

3776
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:32,279
um and so the question of planning is

3777
02:35:32,279 --> 02:35:35,120
not just a question of planning physical

3778
02:35:35,120 --> 02:35:37,680
actions could be you know planning

3779
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:40,080
actions to use tools for a dialog system

3780
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:42,279
or for any kind of intelligent

3781
02:35:42,279 --> 02:35:45,399
system and um there's some work on this

3782
02:35:45,399 --> 02:35:47,399
but not like not a huge amount some work

3783
02:35:47,399 --> 02:35:51,399
at Fair um one called tool former which

3784
02:35:51,399 --> 02:35:53,640
was couple years ago and some more

3785
02:35:53,640 --> 02:35:56,920
recent work on planning U but um but I

3786
02:35:56,920 --> 02:35:59,600
don't think we have like a good solution

3787
02:35:59,600 --> 02:36:02,319
for any of that then there is the

3788
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:04,800
question of hierarchical planning so the

3789
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:07,120
example I I mentioned of you know

3790
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:10,520
planning a trip from New York to Paris

3791
02:36:10,520 --> 02:36:12,279
that's hierarchical but almost every

3792
02:36:12,279 --> 02:36:14,399
action that we take involves

3793
02:36:14,399 --> 02:36:16,439
hierarchical planning in some in some

3794
02:36:16,439 --> 02:36:19,520
sense and we really have absolutely no

3795
02:36:19,520 --> 02:36:21,720
idea how to do this like this's zero

3796
02:36:21,720 --> 02:36:24,240
demonstration of hierarchical

3797
02:36:24,240 --> 02:36:27,160
planning uh in

3798
02:36:27,160 --> 02:36:32,600
AI where the various levels of

3799
02:36:32,600 --> 02:36:34,800
representations that are necessary have

3800
02:36:34,800 --> 02:36:37,800
been learned we can do like two level

3801
02:36:37,800 --> 02:36:39,680
hierarchy hierarchical planning when we

3802
02:36:39,680 --> 02:36:41,399
design the two the two levels so for

3803
02:36:41,399 --> 02:36:44,399
example you have like a a dog lag robot

3804
02:36:44,399 --> 02:36:46,840
right you want it to go from

3805
02:36:46,840 --> 02:36:48,479
the living room to the kitchen you can

3806
02:36:48,479 --> 02:36:51,640
plan a path that avoids the obstacle and

3807
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:54,240
then um you can send this to a lower

3808
02:36:54,240 --> 02:36:56,120
lower level planner that figures out how

3809
02:36:56,120 --> 02:36:57,880
to move the legs to kind of Follow that

3810
02:36:57,880 --> 02:37:00,399
trajectories right so that works but

3811
02:37:00,399 --> 02:37:03,560
that twole planning is designed by hand

3812
02:37:03,560 --> 02:37:08,399
right um we specify what the proper

3813
02:37:08,399 --> 02:37:10,439
levels of abstraction the representation

3814
02:37:10,439 --> 02:37:12,120
that each level of attraction has have

3815
02:37:12,120 --> 02:37:14,319
to be how do you learn this how do you

3816
02:37:14,319 --> 02:37:16,520
learn that hierarchical representation

3817
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:18,560
of action

3818
02:37:18,560 --> 02:37:21,760
plans right we you know with cight and

3819
02:37:21,760 --> 02:37:23,399
deep learning we we can train the system

3820
02:37:23,399 --> 02:37:25,560
to learn hierarchical representations of

3821
02:37:25,560 --> 02:37:28,680
percepts mhm what is the equivalent when

3822
02:37:28,680 --> 02:37:30,000
what you're trying to represent our

3823
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,240
action plans for action plans yeah so

3824
02:37:32,240 --> 02:37:34,319
you want you want basically a robot dog

3825
02:37:34,319 --> 02:37:37,200
or humanoid robot that turns on and

3826
02:37:37,200 --> 02:37:40,000
travels from New York to Paris all by

3827
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:43,359
itself for example all right they might

3828
02:37:43,359 --> 02:37:46,880
have some uh trouble at the at the TSA

3829
02:37:46,880 --> 02:37:48,439
but yeah no but even doing something

3830
02:37:48,439 --> 02:37:51,000
fairly simple like a household task sure

3831
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,840
like you know uh cooking or something

3832
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:55,479
yeah that there's a lot involved it's a

3833
02:37:55,479 --> 02:37:57,880
super complex task we take and once

3834
02:37:57,880 --> 02:37:59,600
again we take it for

3835
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:03,800
granted what hope do you have for um the

3836
02:38:03,800 --> 02:38:04,960
future of

3837
02:38:04,960 --> 02:38:06,840
humanity we're talking about so many

3838
02:38:06,840 --> 02:38:08,479
exciting Technologies so many exciting

3839
02:38:08,479 --> 02:38:10,520
possibilities what gives you hope when

3840
02:38:10,520 --> 02:38:14,200
you look out over the next 10 20 50 100

3841
02:38:14,200 --> 02:38:16,080
years if you look at social media media

3842
02:38:16,080 --> 02:38:17,680
there's a lot of there's there's Wars

3843
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:19,479
going on there's

3844
02:38:19,479 --> 02:38:22,080
division uh there's hatred all this kind

3845
02:38:22,080 --> 02:38:24,600
of stuff that's also part of humanity

3846
02:38:24,600 --> 02:38:27,920
but amidst all that what gives you

3847
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:32,840
hope I don't have that question

3848
02:38:33,439 --> 02:38:38,439
uh we can make Humanity Smarter with

3849
02:38:38,439 --> 02:38:43,080
AI okay I mean AI basically will amplify

3850
02:38:43,080 --> 02:38:44,200
human

3851
02:38:44,200 --> 02:38:47,439
intelligence it's as if if every one of

3852
02:38:47,439 --> 02:38:51,560
us will have a staff of smart AI

3853
02:38:51,560 --> 02:38:54,520
assistants they might be smarter than us

3854
02:38:54,520 --> 02:38:57,040
they'll do our

3855
02:38:57,840 --> 02:39:02,160
bidding perhaps execute a task in ways

3856
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:04,240
that are much better than we could do

3857
02:39:04,240 --> 02:39:06,120
ourselves because they'll be smarter

3858
02:39:06,120 --> 02:39:09,080
than us and so it's like everyone would

3859
02:39:09,080 --> 02:39:12,880
be the the boss of a staff of super

3860
02:39:12,880 --> 02:39:14,640
smart virtual

3861
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:17,279
people so we shouldn't feel threatened

3862
02:39:17,279 --> 02:39:19,399
by by this any more than we should feel

3863
02:39:19,399 --> 02:39:22,520
threatened by being the manager of a

3864
02:39:22,520 --> 02:39:23,880
group of people some of whom are more

3865
02:39:23,880 --> 02:39:26,160
intelligent than

3866
02:39:26,160 --> 02:39:28,720
us I certainly have a lot of experience

3867
02:39:28,720 --> 02:39:32,760
with this of uh you know having people

3868
02:39:32,760 --> 02:39:34,960
working with me who are smarter than me

3869
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:37,640
um that's actually a wonderful thing so

3870
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:40,000
uh having machines that are smarter than

3871
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:43,080
us that assist us in our all of our

3872
02:39:43,080 --> 02:39:44,640
tasks our daily lives whether it's

3873
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,200
professional or personal I think would

3874
02:39:46,200 --> 02:39:48,479
be absolutely wonderful thing because

3875
02:39:48,479 --> 02:39:50,399
intelligence is the

3876
02:39:50,399 --> 02:39:53,399
most um is the commodity that is most in

3877
02:39:53,399 --> 02:39:55,760
demand that that's really what I mean

3878
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:57,399
all the mistakes that Humanity makes is

3879
02:39:57,399 --> 02:39:59,160
because of lack of intelligence really

3880
02:39:59,160 --> 02:40:02,000
or lack of knowledge which is you know

3881
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:05,200
related so um making people smarter

3882
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:08,040
would just can only be better I mean for

3883
02:40:08,040 --> 02:40:09,399
the same reason that you know public

3884
02:40:09,399 --> 02:40:11,640
education is a good

3885
02:40:11,640 --> 02:40:15,279
thing and books are a good thing and the

3886
02:40:15,279 --> 02:40:16,800
internet is also a good thing

3887
02:40:16,800 --> 02:40:18,600
intrinsically and even social networks

3888
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:20,680
are a good thing if you run them

3889
02:40:20,680 --> 02:40:23,120
properly it's difficult but you know you

3890
02:40:23,120 --> 02:40:24,800
can

3891
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:29,040
um uh because you know it

3892
02:40:29,040 --> 02:40:31,399
it's helps the communication of

3893
02:40:31,399 --> 02:40:33,160
information and knowledge and the

3894
02:40:33,160 --> 02:40:34,880
transmission of knowledge so AI is going

3895
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:36,920
to make Humanity

3896
02:40:36,920 --> 02:40:39,640
smarter and the analogy I've been

3897
02:40:39,640 --> 02:40:43,720
using is the fact that perhaps an

3898
02:40:43,720 --> 02:40:46,960
equivalent event in a history of

3899
02:40:46,960 --> 02:40:52,160
humanity to what might be provided by

3900
02:40:52,160 --> 02:40:54,160
journalized is the invention of the

3901
02:40:54,160 --> 02:40:55,840
printing the printing press it made

3902
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:58,279
everybody smarter the fact

3903
02:40:58,279 --> 02:41:02,279
that people could uh have access to um

3904
02:41:02,279 --> 02:41:04,800
two books books were a lot cheaper than

3905
02:41:04,800 --> 02:41:08,399
they were before and so a lot more

3906
02:41:08,399 --> 02:41:10,720
people had an incentive to learn to read

3907
02:41:10,720 --> 02:41:16,760
which wasn't the case before um and

3908
02:41:16,760 --> 02:41:19,640
people became smarter it it enabled the

3909
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:21,920
enlightenment right there wouldn't be an

3910
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:24,600
Enlightenment without the printing press

3911
02:41:24,600 --> 02:41:25,359
it

3912
02:41:25,359 --> 02:41:27,040
enabled

3913
02:41:27,040 --> 02:41:29,920
uh philosophy

3914
02:41:29,920 --> 02:41:34,040
rationalism U escape from religious

3915
02:41:34,040 --> 02:41:36,760
Doctrine um

3916
02:41:36,760 --> 02:41:39,160
democracy

3917
02:41:39,160 --> 02:41:43,680
science uh and certainly without this it

3918
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:44,960
wouldn't be there wouldn't have been

3919
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:46,560
theeran American Revolution the French

3920
02:41:46,560 --> 02:41:49,920
Revolution and so was still be under

3921
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:54,319
feudal regimes perhaps um and so it

3922
02:41:54,319 --> 02:41:57,960
completely transformed the the world

3923
02:41:57,960 --> 02:42:00,160
because people became smarter and kind

3924
02:42:00,160 --> 02:42:03,760
of learn learn about things now it also

3925
02:42:03,760 --> 02:42:06,479
created 200 years of essentially

3926
02:42:06,479 --> 02:42:08,800
religious conflicts in Europe right

3927
02:42:08,800 --> 02:42:10,760
because the first thing that people read

3928
02:42:10,760 --> 02:42:14,960
was the Bible and uh realized that

3929
02:42:14,960 --> 02:42:16,560
perhaps was a different interpretation

3930
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:18,000
of the Bible than what the priests were

3931
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:18,840
telling

3932
02:42:18,840 --> 02:42:21,680
them and so that created the Protestant

3933
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:24,000
movement and created the rift and in

3934
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,160
fact the Catholic School the Catholic

3935
02:42:26,160 --> 02:42:27,680
Church didn't like the idea of the

3936
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:29,920
printing price but they had no choice

3937
02:42:29,920 --> 02:42:31,960
and so it had some bad effects and some

3938
02:42:31,960 --> 02:42:33,439
some good effects I don't think anyone

3939
02:42:33,439 --> 02:42:34,960
today would say that the invention of

3940
02:42:34,960 --> 02:42:36,960
the printing press had a overall

3941
02:42:36,960 --> 02:42:39,560
negative effect despite the fact that it

3942
02:42:39,560 --> 02:42:42,240
created 200 years of religious

3943
02:42:42,240 --> 02:42:46,680
conflicts uh in Europe now compare this

3944
02:42:46,680 --> 02:42:49,080
and I I thought uh I was very proud of

3945
02:42:49,080 --> 02:42:51,680
myself to come and put this analogy but

3946
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:53,680
realized someone else uh came with the

3947
02:42:53,680 --> 02:42:56,160
same idea before me um compare this with

3948
02:42:56,160 --> 02:42:58,920
what happened in the Ottoman Empire the

3949
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:02,560
Ottoman Empire banned the printing press

3950
02:43:02,560 --> 02:43:04,479
for 200

3951
02:43:04,479 --> 02:43:06,439
years

3952
02:43:06,439 --> 02:43:09,640
uh and it didn't ban it uh for all

3953
02:43:09,640 --> 02:43:12,240
languages only for Arabic you could

3954
02:43:12,240 --> 02:43:15,880
actually print books in Latin or Hebrew

3955
02:43:15,880 --> 02:43:18,319
or whatever in the Ottoman Empire just

3956
02:43:18,319 --> 02:43:19,760
not in

3957
02:43:19,760 --> 02:43:22,880
Arabic and

3958
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:26,479
uh I thought it was because the rers

3959
02:43:26,479 --> 02:43:28,600
just wanted to preserve the control over

3960
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:31,200
the population and the Dogma religious

3961
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:34,000
dogma and everything but after talking

3962
02:43:34,000 --> 02:43:40,479
with the uh UAE minister of AI uh

3963
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:44,080
Omar um he told me no there was another

3964
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:48,120
reason uh and the other reason was that

3965
02:43:48,120 --> 02:43:52,560
uh it was to preserve the corporation of

3966
02:43:52,560 --> 02:43:54,960
calligraphers right there's like a an

3967
02:43:54,960 --> 02:43:57,720
art form which is you know writing those

3968
02:43:57,720 --> 02:44:01,720
beautiful yes uh you know Arabic uh

3969
02:44:01,720 --> 02:44:04,200
poems or whatever religious text in in

3970
02:44:04,200 --> 02:44:06,279
the thing and it was very powerful

3971
02:44:06,279 --> 02:44:08,160
Corporation of scribes basically that

3972
02:44:08,160 --> 02:44:11,680
kind of you know run a big chunk of the

3973
02:44:11,680 --> 02:44:13,479
Empire and you know it couldn't put them

3974
02:44:13,479 --> 02:44:15,479
out of business so they you know B the

3975
02:44:15,479 --> 02:44:19,920
Ping press in part to protect that

3976
02:44:20,359 --> 02:44:22,680
business now what's the analogy for AI

3977
02:44:22,680 --> 02:44:24,439
today like who are we protecting by

3978
02:44:24,439 --> 02:44:26,080
Banning AI like who are the people who

3979
02:44:26,080 --> 02:44:28,960
are asking that AI be regulated to

3980
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:32,120
protect their their jobs and of course

3981
02:44:32,120 --> 02:44:34,240
you know there's it's it's a it's a real

3982
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:37,120
question of what is going to be the

3983
02:44:37,120 --> 02:44:38,319
effect

3984
02:44:38,319 --> 02:44:40,840
of you know technological transformation

3985
02:44:40,840 --> 02:44:44,439
like AI on the on the job market and the

3986
02:44:44,439 --> 02:44:46,800
labor market and there are economists

3987
02:44:46,800 --> 02:44:48,840
who are much more expert at this than I

3988
02:44:48,840 --> 02:44:51,000
am but when I talk to them they they

3989
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:52,160
tell

3990
02:44:52,160 --> 02:44:54,120
us you know we're not going to run out

3991
02:44:54,120 --> 02:44:55,920
of job this this not this is not going

3992
02:44:55,920 --> 02:44:58,279
to cause mass unemployment this this

3993
02:44:58,279 --> 02:45:01,279
just going to be gradual uh shift of

3994
02:45:01,279 --> 02:45:02,920
different professions the professions

3995
02:45:02,920 --> 02:45:05,880
are going to be hot 10 or 15 years from

3996
02:45:05,880 --> 02:45:08,040
now we have no idea today what they're

3997
02:45:08,040 --> 02:45:10,439
going to be the same way if we go back

3998
02:45:10,439 --> 02:45:13,040
20 years in the past like who could have

3999
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:15,840
thought 20 years ago that like the

4000
02:45:15,840 --> 02:45:19,840
hardest job even like 5 10 years ago was

4001
02:45:19,840 --> 02:45:21,800
mobile app developer like smartphones

4002
02:45:21,800 --> 02:45:24,279
weren't invented most of the jobs of the

4003
02:45:24,279 --> 02:45:26,000
future might be in in the

4004
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:29,560
metaverse well it could be yeah but the

4005
02:45:29,560 --> 02:45:32,560
point is you can't possibly predict but

4006
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:34,040
you're right I mean you made a lot of

4007
02:45:34,040 --> 02:45:35,240
strong points

4008
02:45:35,240 --> 02:45:37,359
and I I believe that people are

4009
02:45:37,359 --> 02:45:40,319
fundamentally good and so if

4010
02:45:40,319 --> 02:45:44,479
AI especially open source AI can um make

4011
02:45:44,479 --> 02:45:45,720
them smarter

4012
02:45:45,720 --> 02:45:48,359
it just empowers the goodness in humans

4013
02:45:48,359 --> 02:45:51,040
so I I share that feeling okay I think

4014
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:54,840
people are Fally good uh and in fact a

4015
02:45:54,840 --> 02:45:57,200
lot of doomers are doomers because they

4016
02:45:57,200 --> 02:45:58,560
don't think that people are

4017
02:45:58,560 --> 02:46:02,479
fundamentally good uh and they either

4018
02:46:02,479 --> 02:46:05,200
don't trust people or they don't trust

4019
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:07,960
the institution to do the right thing so

4020
02:46:07,960 --> 02:46:09,600
that people behave

4021
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:12,000
properly well I think both you and I

4022
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:14,640
believe in humanity and I think I speak

4023
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:17,319

4025
02:46:19,960 --> 02:46:23,120

4027
02:46:25,200 --> 02:46:27,640

4043
02:46:58,200 --> 02:47:00,720
limits of the possible is to go beyond
